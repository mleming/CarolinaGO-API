￼UNC’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusivity
UnC–Chapel Hill has a long-held tradition of striving for excellence. Quality education takes place among persons with differing social backgrounds, economic circumstances, personal characteristics, philosophical outlooks, life experiences, perspectives, beliefs, and expectations. we at the University acknowledge that we face ongoing challenges to overcome the effects and influences of adverse historical, social, political, and economic factors. A critical element for any 21st- century educational institution is a diverse and inclusive community that functions in a global context. The historical, political, economic, and educational backgrounds of the University, the state, and the nation shape our present circumstances and inform the measures we must
take to accomplish our highest aspirations. The University engages
in teaching, research, and service to expand and discover knowledge, promote educational enlightenment, and improve understanding. we work to assure that we have a complement of students, faculty, and staff that broadly reflects the ways in which people differ. we speak of these differences as representing “diversity.”
UnC’s commitment to diversity excellence began in the 1960s through the support of minority programming and continues today through the work of the office for diversity and Multicultural Affairs (dMA). dMA is an administrative unit in the office of the executive vice Chancellor and Provost. it is lead by the associate provost for diversity and multicultural affairs, who serves as the chief diversity officer and advises the University community on diversity policies and issues. The office collaborates with University officers and campus units to identify and implement strategies and initiatives for achieving the core values with respect to diversity and the goal of increased diversity among students, staff, and faculty. The ultimate goal of both dMA and the University is building an inclusive environment that values and respects the contributions of all members of the Carolina community.

￼The UNC System History of the University
in north Carolina all the public educational institutions that grant baccalaureate degrees are part of the University of north Carolina. The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill is one of the constituent institutions of the multicampus state university.
The University of north Carolina, chartered by the north Carolina General Assembly in 1789, was the first public university in the United states to open its doors and the only one to graduate students in the 18th century. The first class was admitted in Chapel Hill in 1795. for the next 136 years the only campus of the University of north Carolina was at Chapel Hill.
in 1877 the north Carolina General Assembly began sponsoring additional institutions of higher education, diverse in origin and purpose. five were historically black institutions, and another was founded to educate native Americans. several were created to prepare teachers for the public schools. others had a technological emphasis. one is a training school for performing artists.
in 1931 the north Carolina General Assembly redefined the University of north Carolina to include three state-supported institutions: the campus at Chapel Hill (now the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill), north Carolina state College of Agriculture and engineering at raleigh (now north Carolina state University at raleigh) and the north Carolina College for women (woman’s College) at Greensboro (now the University of north Carolina at Greensboro). The new multicampus University operated with one board of trustees and one president. by 1969 three additional campuses had joined the University through legislative action: the University of north Carolina at Charlotte, the University of north Carolina at Asheville, and the University of north Carolina at wilmington.
in 1971 the General Assembly passed legislation bringing into the University of north Carolina the state’s 10 remaining public senior
institutions, each of which had until then been legally separate: Appalachian state University, east Carolina University, elizabeth
City state University, fayetteville state University, north Carolina Agricultural and technical state University, north Carolina Central University, north Carolina school of the Arts, Pembroke state University, western Carolina University, and winston-salem state University. This action created a 16-campus University. in l985 the north Carolina school of science and Mathematics, a residential high school for gifted students, was declared an affiliated school of the University, and it recently became the 17th constituent institution.
The UnC board of Governors is the policy-making body legally charged with “the general determination, control, supervision, management and governance of all affairs of the constituent institutions.” it elects the president, who administers the University. The 32 voting members of the board are elected by the north Carolina General Assembly for four- year terms. former board chairs and board members who are former governors of north Carolina may continue to serve for limited periods as nonvoting members emeriti. The president of the UnC Association of student Governments, or that student’s designee, is also a nonvoting member.
each of the 17 institutions is headed by a chancellor, who is chosen by the board of Governors on the president’s nomination and is responsible to the president. each institution has a board of trustees, consisting
of eight members elected by the board of Governors, four appointed
by the governor, and the president of the student body, who serves ex officio. (The north Carolina school of the Arts has two additional ex officio members.) each board of trustees holds extensive powers over academic and other operations of its institution on delegation from the board of Governors.

UNC–Chapel Hill General Information
History
The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill was the first state university to admit students. it was chartered in 1789 and formally opened in 1795; from early in its history, it has encouraged research and creative activity.
As early as 1853–1854 the catalog of the University carried an announcement of graduate course work. in 1876, after the institution had been closed for the period 1871–1875, the catalog announced
the requirements for the master’s degree, and the next issue carried an announcement of regulations governing the degrees of master of arts, master of science and doctor of philosophy. several graduate degrees were awarded before the turn of the century (the first degree of doctor of philosophy being conferred in 1883), but it was not until 1903 that a separate graduate school with a dean was established.
The Graduate school celebrated its 100th year in 2003 by hosting a national forum on graduate education, numerous student and alumni recognition ceremonies, and by commissioning the book Pioneer to Powerhouse: The History of Graduate Education at Carolina.
in 1922, the graduate faculty voted, first, to vest in the Administrative board of The Graduate school legislative powers in matters that affected graduate education; second, to authorize the Administrative board
to admit members to the teaching faculty of The Graduate school;
and, third, to vest in the Administrative board the responsibility for authorizing curricula and courses carrying graduate credit.
with the exception of the master of business administration (MbA), the master of accounting (MAC), the master’s in clinical laboratory science (MCls), the master’s in radiologic science (Mrs), the master of law (llM), the master of education for experienced teachers (Med), and the master of school administration (MsA), all master’s degrees offered by the University and the degrees of doctor of philosophy, doctor of education (post-2011), and doctor of public health are conferred by The Graduate school.
work toward advanced degrees at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill proceeds under policies and regulations established by the graduate faculty. The immediate direction of The Graduate school is in the charge of the Administrative board, of which the dean is chair. At present, the board consists of academic and health affairs faculty representatives appointed by the chancellor upon nomination by the dean of The Graduate school.
Summer School
The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill established what was possibly the first summer school in America in 1877. The “summer normal school,” as it was then called, enrolled 235 students in courses over ten disciplines. About half the students were teachers; students came from 42 counties across north Carolina and from neighboring states. summer school was the first school at UnC-Chapel Hill to enroll women, beginning in its first year and continuing thereafter. by 1925, records indicate that 19,983 students had enrolled in summer school.
Curricula and courses that are offered during summer school are comparable to those of the fall and spring semesters. summer school
offers two sessions of five weeks each, a three-week Maymester, and other short courses with various beginning and ending dates. The summer program is planned to meet the needs of graduate students who are fulfilling degree requirements in this institution, visiting graduate students who desire to take courses for transfer to other institutions, teachers and administrators who desire to meet state certification requirements, and other students who have special educational objectives.
Graduate students who wish to be admitted or readmitted for the summer to a degree program should contact The Graduate school. The requirements for admission to a degree program starting in the summer are the same as those in the regular academic year. Those who desire other information or those wanting to enroll in the summer as visiting students should visit summer school’s website at summer.unc.edu, or contact summer school via email at summer_school@unc.edu. summer school is located at 134 east franklin street, room 200, Chapel Hill, nC 27599-3340, or telephone (919) 966-4364.
Visiting Scholars
registration as a visiting scholar at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill entitles the registrant to certain privileges of the University, the issuance of a UnC one Card and the use of University facilities for the duration of the visiting scholar’s stay.
eligibility for registration as a visiting scholar is limited to those who (1) are not on the University payroll as employees in any capacity, and (2) are visiting the University under the sponsorship of an academic department or school for the furtherance of scholarly interests. visiting scholars may include faculty members on leave from other institutions of higher learning, postdoctoral fellows or others who hold the terminal degree in their fields and are invited to visit by a department or school.
Persons interested in applying for visiting scholars status should communicate with the appropriate department or school within the University. further details concerning University privileges for visiting scholars are available from the ePA/faculty benefits office, Cb# 1045, 725 Martin luther King Jr. boulevard, Chapel Hill, nC 27599-1045.
The University Year
two semesters of approximately 17 weeks each and a summer school consisting of two sessions (each five and one-half weeks long) constitute the University year. The requirements for admission to graduate programs and for graduate degrees in the summer session are the same as those in the regular academic year. for the schedule of events of particular interest to graduate students, consult the academic calendars at the office of the University registrar (registrar.unc.edu).

telephone: (919) 966-2611 web: gradschool.unc.edu
Graduate School Handbook
The Graduate School Handbook contains most of the policies and procedures of The Graduate school at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill. students should become familiar with the material pertaining to their degree programs, and, together with their faculty advisors, make certain that the chosen program of study complies with all policies. The Handbook may be viewed or downloaded from the Graduate school web site: handbook.unc.edu.
Policies and Guidelines for a Cooperative Learning Environment
teaching and learning occur simultaneously through a partnership between instructor and student. instructors share knowledge, experience and ideas with their students. students process these thoughts,
generate new ones and share them with their teachers. in most cases, students and instructors communicate clearly and effectively. However,
misunderstandings do occur. in an attempt to foster a positive academic environment, the faculty Council, upon recommendation of the educational Policy Committee, establishes these policies and guidelines.
The Faculty Council resolves:
Part I. Policies
Section 1.
The faculty Council recognizes and affirms the following policies. This recognition is not to be interpreted as precluding modification of any policy by the appropriate authority.
The Honor Code. The faculty should inform students of the provisions of the honor code and be aware of their own responsibilities specified in the honor code. faculty responsibilities are stated in the instrument of student Judicial Governance.
Student Grievance Procedures. According to UnC–Chapel Hill student Grievance Committee procedures, students may file a grievance against a UnC–Chapel Hill employee, ePA non-faculty employee, staff employee, or student employee (when acting in the role of employee) when there is a violation of one of the following:
A. The UnC-Chapel Hill sexual Harassment Policy
b. The UnC-Chapel Hill racial Harassment Policy
C. The UnC–Chapel Hill Policy on sexual orientation
d. The Americans with disabilities Act
e. title iX, which prohibits exclusion from participation on the basis of sex
f. section 504 of the rehabilitation Act of 1973, which outlaws discrimination on the basis of a handicap or
G. The family educational rights and Privacy Act, which allows students to challenge the content of their educational records.
Copies of these can be obtained from the office of the dean of students. They contain information about how to file a grievance. A grievance based on incidents that occurred more than six months before the complaint was filed will not be considered.
Student Access to Academic Records—Protection Against Improper Disclosure. As stated in The family educational rights and Privacy
Act of 1974, students may have access to their full academic records. individuals who are, or have been, in attendance at UnC–Chapel Hill may inspect and review their education records. otherwise, education records are subject to confidentiality requirements as specified by law and may not be disclosed improperly. requests for recommendations imply that the student has given consent to the disclosure of information related to ability and performance. Judgments of ability and character may be provided under appropriate circumstances, normally with the knowledge or consent of the student. “education records”
are those records directly related to a student that are maintained by
an educational institution. Particular University policy provisions are found in the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Policies and
￼￼
Procedures under the family educational rights and Privacy Act of 1974.
Appealing a Grade. The University has systems for appealing a grade. The exact procedures vary among the academic units. students should consult with their dean or department chairperson to obtain information about grade appeal procedures.
Part II. Guidelines
Section 2.
The faculty Council endorses the following guidelines for the faculty- student relationship. This endorsement shall not be construed as faculty legislation, is not intended to establish a contractual undertaking by the University or any individual, and shall not constitute the basis for civil action in a court or a claim in any administrative or judicial body of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Clear Definition of Potential Honor Code Violations. in an attempt to avoid unintended misunderstanding, instructors should clearly state what is acceptable in their class. when study aids such as computers are allowed, the instructor is responsible for explaining what constitutes proper use of these items. These rules should be established at the beginning of the course and should not be changed without giving students proper notice.
Assignment of Graded Work during the Last Week of the Semester. instructors may not assign graded work during the last week of classes unless the course syllabus clearly states that such an assignment will be given.
Suggested Classroom Procedures. in general, instructors are strongly encouraged to follow the guidelines for course design and classroom procedures recommended by the Center for faculty excellence. when students enter into a learning relationship, they have certain needs and expectations. They are entitled to information about course procedures, content and goals. instructors should provide a syllabus that describes the course and methods of evaluation. Particular attention should be paid to several areas of special concern to students, including provision of reserve readings and grading policy.
evaluated assignments should be returned to the students within
a reasonable amount of time. since part of the purpose of such assignments is to provide feedback, students should be given time to assess and to learn from their mistakes. ideally, such assessment would take place while the relevant topics are still fresh in their minds.
extra credit, if offered, should be announced publicly and made available to the entire class.
Students Should Have Freedom of Expression. students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study. They are responsible, however, for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. incorrect facts and poorly supported arguments or opinions inevitably have an impact on grades. nothing herein shall be construed to limit the freedom of the faculty to assign grades according to appropriate academic standards.
Responsibilities of Students and Teachers. Just as students ought
to expect instructors who are knowledgeable and well prepared, so should teachers expect their students to be motivated, eager to learn and actively engaged in class. it is the responsibility of teachers to make their courses serious intellectual experiences for themselves and for their students. it is the responsibility of students to take seriously the courses in which they enroll. Good teachers need good learners.
students should understand that they are members of a community of scholars, and membership in such a community is not a passive activity.
to be full participants in the educational community and to maximize the educational value of a class, pre-class preparation is necessary. Proper class preparation involves obtaining course materials as they are needed and completing assignments as they are due. full participation in a class requires regular attendance, arriving on time and remaining until class conclusion, and active involvement in the work of the class.
students should also consider the extent of their own involvement in a class in assessing the educational value of a class.
Grade Appeals
The procedure for grade appeals can be found in the Graduate School Handbook. Any questions regarding the grade appeals process should be directed to The Graduate school.
web: handbook.unc.edu/grading.html
Orientation
The Graduate school sponsors a University-wide orientation program for new graduate and professional students to (1) acclimate them to
the University community and (2) provide information sessions on
a range of topics relevant to graduate students such as broad campus resources, campus health facilities, Graduate and Professional student federation, and getting to know the local area. important reference materials and guides to the campus and Chapel Hill/Carrboro area community resources are available to students on the Graduate school web site: gradschool.unc.edu. These resources include the Graduate School Handbook, Academic Integrity and Ethics, A Guide to Theses and Dissertations, copies of University policies, and other helpful campus and community publications that are intended to be used throughout the students’ graduate careers. As orientation is a continuous process throughout a student’s first year, The Graduate school schedules a number of orientation workshops throughout the academic year on a variety of issues related to graduate students such as residency for tuition purposes, funding, and networking.
in addition to the Graduate school orientation, individual graduate and professional programs conduct department-based orientations for new students. information regarding departmental orientations is available in the respective academic departmental offices.
orientation and relocation information can be found on the web site of The Graduate school at gradschool.unc.edu. The Graduate school office, open year-round, is located on the second floor of bynum Hall. Graduate school staff and are available to answer questions and help students find the resources they need to make the most of their Carolina experience.
Professional Development in Graduate Education
The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to providing students with the highest quality graduate education. while this clearly entails academic training, it also includes a commitment to providing students with resources and services to enhance their graduate experience and to prepare them for their post-student careers.
The cornerstone of professional development at Carolina is a series of workshops and selected one-credit-hour courses. These workshops cover topics designed to promote graduate student academic, professional, and personal growth. sessions are designed to provide students with
the opportunity to develop five areas of professional competency: communication, leadership, teaching and instruction, professional adaptability, and self-awareness.

NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes
More than 30 billion pounds of organic and halogenated solvents
are used worldwide each year as process aids, cleaning agents, and dispersants. Considerably more water is used and contaminated in related processes. in the 21st century, manufacturing and service industries must increasingly attempt to avoid production, use, and subsequent release into the environment of contaminated water, volatile organic solvents, chlorofluorocarbons, and other noxious pollutants. technological breakthroughs of the last decade now indicate that liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide (Co2) could become a very commonly used solvent in overcoming these environmental problems. The s&t Center for environmentally responsible solvents and Processes, established in 1999, has as its goal to develop the scientific fundamentals necessary to enable liquid and supercritical Co2 to replace aqueous
and organic solvents in key processes in the nation’s manufacturing sector. Three key focus areas identified to date are macromolecular synthesis/engineering, microlithography, and nanostructures. This is a multidisciplinary effort with participants from five academic centers and two national laboratories: the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, north Carolina state University, north Carolina A&t University, University of texas at Austin, and Georgia institute of technology in partnership with sandia national laboratory and oak ridge national laboratory.

Center for Faculty Excellence
The Center for faculty excellence provides Carolina faculty holistic support across the entire spectrum of professional development: instruction, research, and leadership skills. The center also provides support to graduate instructors through a wide range of activities and resources. The center provides:
• Resources to individuals who wish to improve their effectiveness as instructors and mentors
• Support and guidance for designing, funding, and undertaking successful research on campus
• Advice and training for faculty members taking on campus leadership roles
￼
The Center for faculty excellence is a new institution, but it is based on an old idea: that a faculty member should be regarded as an individual, and not simply the summation of research (or teaching, or leadership) competencies. The mission of the center is to provide holistic support to that individual across the entire spectrum of professional development: instruction, research, and leadership skills.
Carolina is a rich environment for an academic professional, but it is often difficult for faculty members to take advantage of this richness. The center is designed to implement five core principles in mobilizing or publicizing the University’s resources for faculty: transparency, collaboration, mentoring, comparative advantage, and assessment.
transparency is critical in ensuring that faculty members can recognize and access quickly all available resources. of all scarce resources, faculty time is probably the most valuable. time spent searching for supports on campus is time that could be spent better on instruction or research.
Collaboration among faculty members is a critical support to faculty success in all areas—research, instruction, or leadership. some collaboration is a natural outgrowth of shared interest, but this only scratches the surface of the opportunities for mutual gain offered.
Mentoring best utilizes our considerable faculty strengths to ensure
that the next generation of faculty will be at least as strong. Through mentoring, our more senior faculty pass on accumulated research, instruction, and leadership skills to our more junior faculty—as we have for more than two hundred years.
Comparative advantage is jargon for the fact that each faculty member has a set of characteristics that make him or her uniquely effective as a researcher, instructor, or leader. our metric of faculty success is not that all faculty members will have the same skills in each area. our faculty members will demonstrate a competence in each area, but beyond that our faculty will be free to specialize in those aspects of instruction, research, and leadership in which they are most skilled. The University’s success follows naturally from this specialization.
Assessment is a critical component of any initiative. new ideas often look good on paper, but effectiveness will be measured in their practical application.
As is evident from this list, the center is not really a place; it is a springboard. Good researchers will become great researchers, good instructors will become great instructors, and faculty members will become leaders.

Gene Therapy Center
The University of north Carolina school of Medicine created the Gene Therapy Center in 1993 with the goal of merging molecular genetics research with health care delivery. The Gene Therapy Center provides important resources to academic investigators through two core facilities created to support preclinical and clinical gene therapy studies. These facilities, the vector Core and the Human Applications laboratories, were created to ensure that investigators would have promising gene vectors available in the quality and quantities needed for preclinical or clinical studies. research in the laboratory has centered on the molecular biology of adeno-associated virus (AAv) in order to exploit the unique features of this virus to develop an efficient viral vector system for
use in human gene therapy. Continued efforts in understanding the mechanism of viral replication and integration for both wild-type and recombinant AAv are being pursued in order to create more efficient gene transfer vectors. The ultimate goal of the Gene Therapy Center
is to facilitate the progression and translation of gene therapy research from the laboratory bench into Phase i clinical trials for the treatment of human disease.

Injury Prevention Research Center
injury is a major, but under-recognized, public health problem worldwide. in the United states alone, about 150,000 people die of injuries each year, resulting in more years of life lost before age 65 than any other single health problem. in addition to loss of life, the pain, suffering, and long-term disability associated with injuries are enormous. Most of these injuries are preventable, but there is much to learn.
More must be understood about the factors that influence when, how, where, and to whom injuries will occur, and effective and appropriate intervention strategies must be designed and implemented.
The UnC injury Prevention and research Center (iPrC) envisions a world in which injuries are reduced as a result of important discoveries made and disseminated in a scholarly manner to guide policies and program development. its vision includes a leadership role for UnC iPrC in effecting change both nationally and internationally.

￼University Regulations and Policies
The Honor Code
Persons enrolled in The Graduate school are members of the student body of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, and are held responsible for conducting themselves in conformity with the moral and legal restraints found in any law-abiding community. They are, moreover, subject to the regulations of the Honor Code.
The Honor Code is the heart of integrity at Carolina. in brief, the Honor Code states that all students shall “refrain from lying, cheating, or stealing,” but the Honor Code imparts much more. it is the guiding force behind the responsible exercise of freedom, the foundation of student self-governance at UnC–Chapel Hill. by abiding by the Honor Code, students can be assured that their individual rights and academic work will be respected.
Mutual Responsibilities of the Faculty and Students
Academic work is a joint enterprise involving faculty and students. both have a fundamental investment in the enterprise and both must share responsibility for ensuring its integrity. in relation to the Honor Code, therefore, specific responsibilities of the faculty which parallel the responsibilities of the students have been formally adopted by the faculty Council.
Responsibilities of the Faculty
i. Awareness: to assure that community-wide expectations regarding academic integrity are understood and communicated, and that students are held accountable for conforming their conduct to such expectations.
ii. Communicating expectations and Administering examinations: to assist students in complying with their responsibilities relating to academic integrity, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should
A. Use good judgment in setting and communicating clear ground rules for academic work conducted under their supervision.
b. require students to sign the honor pledge as a condition of submitting academic assignments.
C. take steps to prevent unauthorized access to examinations during development, duplication, and administration.
d. Avoid reusing prior examinations in whole or in part to the extent possible.
e. take all reasonable steps consistent with physical classroom conditions to reduce the risk of cheating during the administration of examinations.
f. Maintain proper security during the administration of examinations, including as appropriate overseeing distribution and collection of examinations and proctoring the examination session.
iii. oversight: in the event of student misconduct that appears to violate the requirements of the Honor Code, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should
A. report to the appropriate student Attorney General any instance in which the instructor has reasonable basis to conclude that a student under the faculty member’s supervision has engaged in academic dishonesty or substantially assisted another to do so in connection with academically related work.
b. in the instructor’s discretion, notify the student of the instructor’s intention to report the suspected academic dishonesty and permit the student to provide relevant further information if the student chooses to do so.
C. refrain from taking unilateral punitive action as to a student rather than reporting conduct in suspected violation of the Honor Code.
d. Cooperate with representatives of the Honor system in conducting necessary investigation, providing testimony or other evidence, recommending appropriate sanctions, or otherwise bringing the matter to prompt conclusion.
iv. involvement: to bring to bear requisite faculty judgment regarding the nature and importance of academic integrity, and to nourish a strong campus-wide understanding and commitment to associated intellectual and personal values, faculty members, teaching assistants, and other instructional personnel should
A. explore issues of integrity in connection with instructional activities where relevant and appropriate.
b. encourage their academic units to take matters of academic integrity seriously, become informed regarding related problems and advisable means of preventing problems from arising,
and provide requisite training and support to instructional personnel.
C. Participate upon request as part of educational initiatives, faculty advisory panels, and University Hearing boards designed to create, nurture, and enforce high standards of academic integrity within the University community.
Responsibilities of Students
in order to ensure effective functioning of an Honor system worthy of respect in this institution, students are expected to
i. Conduct all academic work within the letter and spirit of the Honor Code, which prohibits the giving or receiving of unauthorized aid in all academic processes.
ii. Consult with faculty and other sources to clarify the meaning of plagiarism, to learn the recognized techniques of proper attribution of sources used in the preparation of written work, and to identify allowable resource materials or aids to be used during examination or in completion of any graded work.
￼￼
iii. sign a pledge on all graded academic work certifying that no unauthorized assistance has been received or given in the completion of the work.
iv. Comply with faculty regulations designed to reduce the possibility of cheating—such as removing unauthorized materials or aids from the room and protecting one’s own examination paper from the view of others.
v. Maintain the confidentiality of examinations by divulging no information concerning an examination, directly or indirectly, to another student yet to write that same examination.
vi. treat all members of the University community with respect and fairness.
vii. report any instance in which reasonable grounds exist to believe that a student has given or received unauthorized aid in graded work or in other respects violated the Honor Code. such report should be made to the office of the student Attorney General, the office of the dean of students, or other appropriate officer or official of their college or school.
viii. Cooperate with the office of the student Attorney General and the defense counsel in the investigation and hearing of any incident of alleged violation, including the giving of testimony when called upon.
Procedure for Reporting
Members of the University community who wish to report possible violations of the Honor Code should contact the student Attorney General (966-4084) or the office of the dean of students (966-4042). faculty members who have cause to report a student should use the online report form available at the following web site: honor.unc.edu.

Transportation and Parking
Parking
every student at UnC–Chapel Hill and UnC Hospitals who parks
an automobile between 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays in the University’s designated reserved parking is required by the department of Public safety to obtain and display a parking permit. Parking permit holders must park only in specific zones as indicated on their parking permits. After 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, however, students may park in any unreserved space except those in resident student lots, which are reserved until 9:00 p.m. Please note the signs at the entrances to each lot which detail the hours of enforcement for that parking area.
Motor vehicle parking permits may be applied for during online registration procedures at the department of Public safety. vehicles found parked illegally may be cited by the department of Public safety’s Parking Control division, and subsequent violations may result in further citations, immobilization (“booting”), or towing of the vehicle. Citations may be appealed through the department of Public safety’s Appeals office within 10 calendar days upon receipt of the citation. Citations can be appealed in person during office hours Monday through friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., online at www.dps.unc. edu, or by regular mail.
The Parking Control division operates MAP, the cost-free Motorist Assistance Program. if a vehicle requires a “jump start” or if the keys are locked inside the vehicle, motorists may call for assistance at 962-8006 (weekdays 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.). during all other times (and on University holidays), the UnC Police department should be contacted for motorist assistance at 962-8100.
The Commuter Alternatives Program
The Commuter Alternatives Program (CAP) is an initiative with
the goal of reducing campus traffic congestion and parking demand through the promotion and management of viable alternatives to single-occupancy vehicle use at UnC–Chapel Hill. it is a free program designed to reward campus community members for the use of
bicycling, walking, transit, park and ride services, and ridesharing.
CAP requires only that a registrant commute to UnC from outside a two-mile radius from the bell tower at the center of the campus and not be registered for a parking permit. CAP has a listserv, giveaways, prizes, discounts to local merchants, and daily benefits in relation to alternative transportation programs. for more information or to request a brochure, call the department of Public safety at (919) 962-3951 or visit the student CAP link on the department’s web site at www.dps. unc.edu/transit/gettingtowork/CAP/studentcap.cfm.
Alternatives to Parking
The web site www.redefinetravel.org provides excellent information
on student transportation alternatives. redefinetravel.org is designed
to give students all the information needed to ride the bus, ride with friends, or bike to great destinations throughout the triangle. The site includes a transit trip Planner to popular destinations; schedules for triangle transit, durham Area transit Authority, Capital Area transit, and Chapel Hill transit; information about triangle transit’s express bus to raleigh; bike safety information and city bike maps; a calorie counter to show how active transportation affects health; information on student carpool options; and a calculator tool that calculates how much an individual can save by using alternative transportation.
Municipal and Regional Transit
The University, Chapel Hill, and Carrboro work together to provide the fare-free Chapel Hill transit system. no exchange of money, coupons, or display of a bus pass is needed when boarding a Chapel Hill transit bus. Campus U route and rU (reverse U) shuttles run in continuous loops from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., serving nearly every area on campus.
Commuting students can use any of the town park and ride lots, or they can join the Commuter Alternative Program and gain access to additional CAP (Commuter Alternative Program) park-and-ride lots. Chapel Hill transit provides free and quick service to and from campus to the park-and-ride lots. student CAP participants receive one one-day occasional use pass per semester allowing free parking on s11 zoned lots. in addition, in the case of an emergency, UnC–Chapel Hill’s emergency ride back service is available to provide transportation to the park-and-ride lots or any location within Carrboro or Chapel Hill municipal boundaries. Consult the Chapel Hill transit web site at www.chtransit.org for information on specific routes.
regional transit (to and from rdU, raleigh, and durham) is available aboard triangle transit buses. included in the full complement of regional service is express service from raleigh to UnC–Chapel Hill and from Hillsborough to UnC–Chapel Hill. for more route information, call triangle transit at (919) 485-ride or visit www.triangletransit.org.
Commuting students must join CAP by visiting the department of Public safety building, bringing proof of their Pid number. if the student is a licensed driver, then he or she must also present a driver’s license, plate, make and model of any vehicles owned and proof of auto insurance.
Park-and-Ride Lots
There are four town park-and-ride lots and five additional lots available to those who join UnC–Chapel Hill’s Commuter Alternative Program. Many commuting students find the park-and-ride services to be a reliable transportation solution. triangle transit also serves some of the lots. The nine lots encircle the campus, and space is available on a first- come, first-served basis. Parking at the preferred lot is usually possible, but not guaranteed as the most popular lots fill up by the end of rush hour.

￼Certificate Programs
Programs have various options when developing specialized studies for postbaccalaureate, graduate, and professional students. A Certificate Program is a formal program of courses and other related experiences in a field of specialization. in some disciplines, a certificate is akin to
a professional credential, while in others, a certificate is recognition of competence in a given skill, practice, or field of study. like an academic degree, a Certificate Program is offered by a host academic school, department, or curriculum and is related to an academic area of study. it carries academic credit. The campus encourages interdisciplinary and inter-institutional Certificate Programs where appropriate. All certificate programs that award academic credit, regardless of intended audience, are governed within The Graduate school.
for additional information about certificate programs, please see gradschool.unc.edu/policies/certificates.html.

The American studies department is the home for the master’s degree in folklore. it also offers graduate courses that may be taken as part
of a graduate minor by students admitted in other departments. requirements for these, and for the M.A. and Ph.d. degrees in American studies, follow.
Ph.D. in American Studies
amerstud.unc.edu/programs/graduate-studies/ph-d-in-american-studies/
Recruitment and Admissions
Application for admission must be made on forms provided by The Graduate school or by The Graduate school’s electronic application process. These also serve as applications for fellowships and assistantships if the applicant marks the appropriate statement on the form.
Applicants for advanced degrees must have completed an undergraduate degree. students will be admitted from a wide range of undergraduate programs, and some will be admitted with an M.A. from American studies or another relevant department. Candidates for admission should be firmly grounded in the humanities, social sciences, or the arts. The best qualified students should articulate an interest in American history, literary, expressive and/or material culture, and/or critical theory, should show some familiarity with library, web-based, and/or ethnographic research methods, and should offer a specific rationale for their interest in the UnC–Chapel Hill graduate program. in addition to the Graduate school application form, candidates for admission
will present a twenty to twenty-five page writing sample, a statement
of purpose, three letters of recommendation, official undergraduate transcripts, Gre aptitude scores, and a curriculum vitae. transfer credits may be awarded at the department’s discretion on the basis of course equivalencies.
Degree Requirements
All students will be admitted to the doctoral program at UnC–Chapel Hill. Applicants do not need a master’s degree prior to admission in the program. The M.A. degree in American studies is typically earned at
the end of the fourth semester, but students planning to earn a terminal master’s degree will not be admitted to the program. students admitted with an M.A. in a related field such as folklore will take some additional core courses as they progress toward the American studies Ph.d.
For the Master of Arts Degree in American Studies
30 credit hours, of which at least 21 must be in American studies, including:
• AMST 700, The History and Practices of American Studies • AMST 701, Interdisciplinary Research Methodologies
• AMST 702, Readings in American Studies
• AMST 901, M.A.Research Seminar
• AMST 992, Thesis Substitute
• Two more courses drawn from American Studies and Folklore
graduate offerings
• Additional courses (9 credit hours) in American Studies or other
related departments
• A capstone project (thesis substitute) with oral defense
At least two semesters in residence.
Capstone Project
The department of American studies requires a capstone project, which replaces the traditional master’s thesis and will be submitted, after revision, in the second month of the student’s fourth semester. This paper, which may stem from previous work in the student’s career, usually will be 35-50 pages in length and should take the form of a potentially publishable essay or equivalent project. This requirement
is in accord with the best practices in humanities departments at UnC–Chapel Hill and peer institutions, and recognizes the fact that successful students often publish work during their graduate careers. The Capstone Project will be read by a three-person committee consisting
of the student’s primary advisor and two other members of the graduate faculty, at least one of whom must come from the American studies faculty.
After the defense and discussion among the committee members, the student’s advisor will convey in writing to the director of Graduate study an evaluation of the Capstone Project and the student’s progress to date.
Colloquium
All students enrolled in the American studies graduate program will participate throughout their graduate careers in a monthly colloquium in which faculty and Ph.d. candidates will offer presentations of
their work-in-progress. The colloquium exposes graduate students to the research interests of faculty in American studies and allied fields, and may also include visiting graduate students and faculty from international partner institutions. The Colloquium is the collegial wellspring of the program, the intellectual and social center of the American studies community, the conversation occurring there will naturally both inform and be informed by classroom work, particularly in AMst 700, 701, and 702, will help to shape, against the backdrop of individual specializations, a common discourse, and in large part provide a site for the formation of the American studies social and intellectual community.
￼
Assessment
The American studies graduate faculty will meet in the spring semester to evaluate the progress toward degree of first-year students, and
to review second-year students who have completed their capstone projects, consider the assessment of each student’s committee, and evaluate the student’s process toward the Ph.d. for students who elect not to continue in the program or whom the faculty does not believe to be progressing satisfactorily, the submission and defense of the capstone project will conclude their course of study at UnC and departmental financial support.
• Factors for satisfactory progress include:
• Academic performance reflected primarily in seminars and
independent studies;
• Contributions to the intellectual life of the program and
department;
• Successful and timely completion of the capstone requirement;
• Recommendation of the student’s advisor and director of graduate
studies.
• The M.A. degree will be awarded after completion of all courses
required for the M.A. and the capstone project.
The Ph.D. in American Studies
with its continuing emphasis upon interdisciplinarity and collegiality, the Ph.d. program in American studies provides candidates with a number of occasions, including the ongoing monthly Colloquium,
for sharing discourses and ideas, developing research areas and dissertation topics, and designing, collaboratively, comprehensive examination reading lists reflecting both local consensus and individual concentration. The Ph.d. curriculum balances particular American studies graduate course offerings within American studies itself with cognate courses across the Arts and sciences graduate curricula; within these the Ph.d. candidate will develop three specific fields. for all students, “American studies” will constitute the major field, and the other two field concentrations will reflect specializations defined by the student and his/her committee. examples of fields include American indian studies, southern studies, folklore, visual and Material Culture, American literature, U.s. History, American religious studies, ethnic studies, or other relevant areas that reflect the strengths of the faculty
in American studies and in cognate departments. A teaching portfolio of syllabus, bibliography, lesson plan, sample lectures, and related material, will demonstrate pedagogical and scholarly proficiency in
one of the field concentrations. in some cases, the director of graduate studies may approve the substitution of a professional portfolio directed toward museum, archival, or public history applications of the field. The major field and second field concentration will be assessed by means of comprehensive exams. An Advisory Committee will assist the candidate in course selection, help to define areas of specialization, administer
the comprehensive examination, approve the student’s dissertation prospectus, assess progress towards completion, and finally read the student’s dissertation and approve the oral defense of dissertation.
The department of American studies offers a separate M.A. degree in folklore. students in the folklore M.A.may apply for admission to the Ph.d. in American studies. Admission to the M.A.in folklore does not constitute admission to the Ph.d. in American studies.
The Ph.d. program seeks to incorporate flexibility in course options and to allow students to fulfill basic requirements in a variety of ways suited to their progress in consultation with their advisors. it is our intention that greater flexibility in the degree requirements related to core courses will allow faculty to offer more thematic or topical research seminars designed to attract students from a variety of fields.
For the Ph.D. Degree in American Studies
An additional 24 credit hours, including:
• AMST 890, Topics in American Studies
• AMST 902, Ph.D. Research Seminar
• AMST 994, Dissertation Registration (6 hours)
• Additional courses (12 credit hours) in American Studies or other
related departments
• Demonstration of proficiency in one language other than English • Successful completion of written comprehensive examinations in
three fields (one takes the form of the teaching portfolio)
• Successful completion of a comprehensive oral examination • Dissertation prospectus and oral defense
• Ph.D. dissertation
• Successful completion of an oral defense of dissertation
At all stages of progress to degree students are encouraged to seek funding for summer advanced language training and pre-dissertation field research as needed.
Assessment
student progress toward the Ph.d. will be assessed annually by the American studies faculty.
Factors for satisfactory progress include:
• Academic performance reflected primarily in completion of coursework and performance in seminars and independent studies;
• Contributions to the intellectual life of the program and department;
• Language proficiency;
• Comprehensive exams, including teaching portfolio;
• Dissertation proposal;
• Recommendation of the student’s advisor and director of
graduate studies.
Language Proficiency
Ph.d. candidates will have demonstrated reading proficiency in one language other than english before the beginning of their fifth year of study (third year if admitted with an M.A.).
language competence may be demonstrated in one of three ways:
• An undergraduate degree in language study;
• Successful completion of a university-administered language
examination or other examination approved by the director of
graduate studies;
• Successful completion (at least a B grade) of an undergraduate
literature course in any language other than english. such a course will not count toward required graduate credits.
Teaching Portfolio
students will prepare a teaching portfolio, to be submitted as part of
the comprehensive exams. The teaching portfolio will demonstrate competence in course and curricular development, class preparation
and classroom performance, as well as proficiency in scholarly and pedagogical uses of digital technologies, and will constitute the written exam in one of the student’s field concentrations. The teaching portfolio is an exercise in course planning, not necessarily a course actually taught. Potential topics are limitless, since the portfolio will highlight a field of concentration individualized for each student. it should be envisioned as a senior seminar or capstone course on a topic of the student’s devising, not a standard introductory or methodological course. over the years, students will continue to produce new and innovative portfolios, just as
AMeriCAn stUdies 47
￼￼
48 www.UnC.edU/GrAdreCord
￼they will produce original dissertation proposals. The teaching portfolio will include the following:
• Complete syllabus including a fourteen week class schedule, requirements, readings, and student assessment;
• Bibliography divided into the core bibliography for students in the projected course and the comprehensive bibliography used by the instructor for course development;
• Sample lectures including notes, supporting materials such as digital image presentations and/or audio content;
• Related supporting material as deemed appropriate.
occasionally, students may choose to prepare a professional portfolio in their field concentration directed toward museum, archival, or public history applications of the field. requirements for such a portfolio will be determined by the director of graduate studies in conjunction with the student and his/her committee.
Teaching and Professional Development
All students will be expected to teach as part of their service requirement for financial aid. teaching experience is fundamental to preparation
for the professoriate. in their first year of graduate study, students
may participate, under supervision, in collaborative faculty-student undergraduate teaching assignments. (students entering with a
Master’s degree may begin teaching in their first year). students may also apply for teaching assistantships in undergraduate courses. After supervised classroom teaching (tA), depending upon the availability of assistantships, students may develop and teach undergraduate courses in their special topics. The teaching Portfolio may provide the basis for an independently taught course.
Comprehensive Exams
Comprehensive exams will be held normally in the spring of the third year for students admitted with a b.A. and in the spring of the second year for students admitted with an M.A. reading lists will emerge
from students’ work in AMst 902. students and faculty will work collaboratively, with the aim of integrating the best work with the most current scholarship in particular fields. The Ph.d. Comprehensive examination will address reading lists in two fields (the successful completion of a teaching Portfolio constitutes the third exam) and will be administered in the form of two three-hour written sessions, one in the American studies major field and one in the field concentration. The major and field concentration exams will be offered on separate days
no more than ten working days apart. The exam schedule will be set by the director of graduate studies and announced the previous semester. individual students and their faculty committees will collaborate to set the parameters of the exams with core materials covered in the major exam in “American studies” and individual reading lists developed for the field concentration. shortly after passing the written exam, students will undergo a 90-minute oral exam covering the American studies major and the field concentrations. students are expected to receive passing evaluations in all three examination areas as well as the oral exam. Any student who fails one or more sections of the exam may repeat the failed section(s) only once.
Doctoral Dissertation
The dissertation prospectus will normally be due within three months of the successful completion of the Comprehensive exams and the acceptance of the teaching Portfolio. Meetings with the student’s doctoral advisory committee will refine the proposal. The prospectus must be approved by the committee following a prospectus defense. students should normally plan to complete the doctoral dissertation during the spring of the third year of doctoral studies (the fifth year of matriculation for students beginning the program without an MA; the
third year for students admitted with an MA).
students register for AMst 994 once they have passed their comprehensive exams. AMst 994 registration allows students to conduct dissertation research on or away from campus. A minimum of 6 hours are required and cannot be taken simultaneously during one semester.
• Dissertation writing groups. The department strongly urges students to participate in dissertation writing groups with other students in their same field or with similar interests or approaches.
• Dissertation defense. Upon completion of the Dissertation, all degree candidates must successfully defend their dissertations before a committee of at least five faculty consisting of their advisory committee supplemented by two other qualified members.
M.A. in Folklore
folklore.unc.edu
The folklore Program, which operates within the departmental structure of American studies, offers a M.A. in folklore that is wholly independent of the American studies graduate program. our program focuses on the study of creativity and aesthetic expression in everyday life and on the social and political implications of this expression as it unfolds in the contested arenas of culture. not bound to traditional definitions of folklore, and committed to preparing students for ethical practice in a multicultural world, the folklore Program offers a flexible M.A. curriculum that readies students for both public practice and further academic study.
The second decade of the 21st century marks the seventh decade of
the folklore Program’s presence at UnC–Chapel Hill. founded with
an eye to regional study and deeply integrated with the University’s long-standing focus on southern history, literature, and culture, the program maintains its commitment to the study of regional folklife. This dedication, however, in no way limits the program’s vision. while students and faculty do much of their fieldwork in the south, they
also work in a range of other regions and countries. faculty interests cluster in the areas of music, language, and narrative, African American culture, public folklore, gender, material culture, vernacular architecture and landscape, foodways, self-taught art, occupational folklife, and
the politics of culture. deeply committed to collaborative work in the public realm, folklore program members work extensively with local communities, pursuing projects with museums, arts councils, media production companies, and a range of other organizations.
of particular interest to students and scholars interested in the folklore Program are the University’s extensive library and archival collections. UnC’s libraries have extensive holdings of books, manuscripts, periodicals, images, and both field and commercial sound and visual recordings relating to vernacular culture, with especially strong and growing holdings for the American south and the british isles. Particularly notable among these collections are the Archie Green occupational folklife Collection, the Mike seeger Collection of southern vernacular music, the don yoder Collection of American religious tune books, and the John edwards Memorial Collection of early southern commercially recorded folk and popular music, all part of the southern folklife Collection.
Degree Requirements: The M.A. program in folklore balances flexibility and a focus on students’ own areas of interest with requirements designed to insure knowledge of key issues and texts in the discipline. Master’s students must complete 10 courses (30 hours). two specific courses—Approaches to folklore Theory (folK 850) and The
￼
Art of ethnography (folK 860)—are required, and students must take three other courses offered by core faculty. students also traditionally take courses in a variety of associated graduate programs, including anthropology, communications studies, english, history, and music, or take advantage of the opportunity to enroll in courses at neighboring universities, particularly those offered at the Center for documentary studies at duke. students pursuing an M.A. must compile a critical literature review at the beginning of their third semester, and must complete and defend a thesis at the end of their second year of study. They must also demonstrate reading proficiency in a language other than english.
students may also opt for a folklore minor in another Ph.d. program. students pursuing the minor complete six courses, chosen in consultation with the program coordinator.
Graduate Minor in American Studies
amerstud.unc.edu/programs/graduate-studies/graduate-minor
The Curriculum
American studies is a nationally and internationally recognized field, comprising the interdisciplinary study of American culture. The object
of study is American culture in all its diversity, and the methodologies include historical, literary, and visual analysis as well as ethnography, sociology, economics, and political science as appropriate. The American studies department at UnC offers courses in the theory and methodology of American studies and in concentrations including American indian studies, folklore, material culture studies, and southern studies. The American studies graduate minor serves students admitted in a variety
of departments, including art, communications studies, english, history, religious studies, and others. interdisciplinary training can enhance scholarly and teaching capabilities for these students.
Applications
see the department chair or director of graduate studies. requirements for the Minor in American studies
The graduate minor consists of five courses, to be selected with the advice of the chair or director of graduate studies in American studies. These courses should include AMst 700 or 701 and at least two other graduate courses with American studies designation. Additional courses may be chosen from cognate departments.

The department of Anthropology offers advanced work leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees. students admitted into the graduate program are admitted for the Ph.d. degree. A master’s degree may be taken as part of the program leading to the Ph.d. degree; however, a master’s degree is not an essential part of the doctoral program.
concentrating in archaeology or biological anthropology, the research labs in Archaeology offer opportunities for student-led investigations as well as analysis of existing collections of archaeological material.
The department of Anthropology works closely with the institute for research in social science, the institute for the study of the Americas, the Carolina Population Center, and the research laboratories of Archaeology.
Up-to-date lists of anthropology faculty and courses, along with additional information about the graduate program, faculty research projects, and other information, are available on the department’s web site: anthropology.unc.edu.

￼￼in order to organize constellations of research interest, five paths of study have been identified, which consist of three concentrations and two programs. Concentrations include history, meaning and materiality; ecology and evolution; and social formations and processes. Programs are offered in medical anthropology and archaeology. students are expected to take at least three courses from within their chosen area of concentration or from a set of courses designated by the program in medical anthropology or the program in archaeology.
Programs are distinguished from concentrations by their institutional links to other faculty and administrative units on campus, and by their greater specificity for certain course requirements. students interested in one or the other program are advised to so declare when they enter the department if they have not yet done so. students interested in choosing a concentration may make this choice after beginning their graduate work. The choice of concentration or program must be made by the end of the student’s third semester. whichever path the student chooses, the faculty expects all students to obtain broad training in anthropology.
to this end, graduate students may take courses offered by other departments or institutions such as duke University. departmental policy is to help the student select courses that supplement and strengthen their specialization in anthropology.
incoming graduate students are required to complete the appropriate two-semester core course sequence for their concentration: sociocultural Theory and ethnography (AntH 701, 702) or evolution and ecology (AntH 703, 704). in addition, incoming students will either choose to complete the remaining core course sequence, or take one course from that sequence and Archaeological Theory (AntH 705). other courses are selected from a list of concentration courses, field research courses, and professional preparation courses.
during the second year of study, graduate students are required to produce a substantial piece of independent research, advised by a three- member faculty committee and presented to the entire faculty at the end of the fourth semester. Graduate students are advised to take their written and oral Ph.d. exams by the end of the sixth semester.
The Ph.d. degree requires specialization in a defined area of study and the completion of an acceptable dissertation treating some problem within this area. The Ph.d. program is quite flexible; any area or problem can be selected for study, provided it meets the approval of the student’s advisor, the Ph.d. committee, and the faculty. Part of the training of a professional anthropologist is based on a minimum of one year’s fieldwork, which provides the context for the dissertation data in sociocultural anthropology or human ecology. for students

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)
Overview
The master of fine arts program in studio art is a community of dedicated and diverse fine arts professionals. we recognize and respond to the universal human need for visual expression, and the indispensable role of the visual arts and visual communication in contemporary society. we recognize the necessity of intellectual curiosity and creative discipline as components of a quality learning environment and respect the conversation between intuition and intellect that contributes to transformative art- making. we encourage exploration and experimentation that crosses intellectual and methodological boundaries while simultaneously respecting and engaging the history and traditions of art.
in the context of a research i institution, the UnC M.f.A. program stands as a site of synthesis, where extensive intellectual and creative resources are available to students in their pursuit of self expression. we seek students who are technically adept, critically aware, and dedicated to their passion for art-making. with these qualities as a point of
Art 61

￼departure, faculty work closely with students to encourage aesthetic and intellectual inquiry, impart versatile skills, and motivate self-exploration. our resolve is to help students create outstanding works of art.
M.F.A. Curriculum
The master of fine arts degree at UnC–Chapel Hill is a two-year, 60-hour program. Credits are earned through studio practice, formal critique, professional development, and academic electives. Additionally, a teaching foundation class is available for students who wish to prepare for an academic career. while this class is optional, it is required for students who wish to apply for teaching fellowships in the M.f.A. program.
Most students take advantage of this opportunity and receive teaching fellowships that provide the opportunity to teach their own class.
Credits for studio practice constitute the majority of credits. These are earned through independent study and critique. All M.f.A. students have individual studio space to support their creative research. with the department’s interdisciplinary approach, students need not choose a particular medium for specialization. They may use different media to express a variety of aesthetic and conceptual goals. This however, does not preclude a media focus, but does mean that media choices are integral to students’ intellectual and aesthetic explorations.
The structure for feedback in the program is through weekly critiques, where students interact with the studio faculty over the course of the semester. A series of formal reviews bring the entire faculty together to evaluate each student’s progress at the end of the first, second, and fourth semester.
The academic component of the M.f.A. program is designed to complement the art making process. The program strongly believes that the decision to pursue the making of fine art in an academic context carries an attendant responsibility to develop the verbal and written articulation of the visual. to help achieve this goal, students participate each semester in a graduate seminar (three credit hours). Contemporary critical issues surrounding the making of art are explored and debated in this group forum. Practical aspects of an art career (grant writing, professional presentation, networking with galleries and museums,
etc.) make up the professional development component of the seminar. The balance of these components will vary from semester to semester, reflecting the focus of the various faculty teaching the course.
other academic credits are satisfied by a requisite six hours of additional course work in art history and/or related fields. students select these courses depending on the focus of their studio explorations, thus stretching the capacity of their creative work. Usually students are urged to take one of these courses in the area of contemporary art history.
The remaining academic credits are earned through the master’s thesis. This includes the preparation of the thesis exhibition and the writing
of the thesis document. At the end of the students’ final semester,
they mount a group exhibition of the thesis work produced under the direction of a thesis committee. students write a thesis statement to accompany the thesis work. A final oral defense takes place during the time of the exhibition. once the oral defense has been passed, students submit a copy of the thesis statement (along with documentation of the thesis work) for permanent retention in the sloane Art library.
in addition to the core curriculum, the UnC–Chapel Hill master of fine arts program supports students by bringing artists and cwritics
to UnC throughout the year. for our Hanes visiting Artist lecture series, artists are typically invited to campus for a two-day visit during which they give a public lecture and provide private critiques for the department’s graduate students. in addition, each semester one artist is invited for a longer two-week residency. Graduate students have the opportunity to interact with these artists in a variety of settings. This
program has proved to be a vital conduit for graduate students to see the work of, and interact with, a large and diverse number of professional artists. Additionally, once a semester the department brings to campus a critic, gallerist or other art professional to further introduce students to the professional art world, furthering knowledge and fostering mutually beneficial practical and professional connections and relationships.
Financial Aid for Studio Art Students
All applicants for admission to the M.f.A. program are automatically considered for nomination for merit awards offered by The Graduate school. Additional support in the form of assistantships and/or specially designated awards is administered directly by the department. students may apply for teaching fellowships after they have completed the teaching practicum course.* students desiring financial aid should consult as early as possible the office of scholarships and student Aid (studentaid.unc.edu/) for information about work-study jobs and loans.
*Students with demonstrable teaching experience at the college level are exempt from this course.
Admission Requirements — M.F.A.
we seek applications from individuals committed to their development as professional artists. while the majority of applicants hold a bachelor’s degree in art, we also welcome applications from students who hold undergraduate degrees in other fields and can present a strong art portfolio. students who do not have a bachelor’s degree in art should have at least one basic-level and one intermediate-level course in art history in preparation for the graduate-level course work in art history required of M.f.A. students. Applicants to the M.f.A. program are not required to take the Graduate record exam (Gre).

Master of Arts (M.A.) and the Doctorate (Ph.D.)
in Art History
in addition to completing an application to The Graduate school (which must include up-to-date Gre scores), the candidate for admission to the programs in art history must submit an example of his/her written work. The writing sample should be no more than 15 pages. All applicants for graduate study in art history are admitted to the program as candidates for the master of arts degree unless they have already received or expect to receive the M.A. degree in art history from another institution. An undergraduate major in art history is
not required for M.A. candidacy; however, entering candidates must have taken a minimum of twenty-four semester hours in art history, archaeology, cultural anthropology, or aesthetics.
There are no spring semester admissions in art history.
Degree Requirements for Art History
Master of Arts Degree
The master of arts degree generally follows the requirements of The Graduate school as described in the section on graduate degree requirements in the Graduate School Handbook.
Purpose of the M.A. degree: both a broad knowledge of world art and a basic sampling of the diverse theory and methods employed by our faculty in the discipline of art history.
The master’s program in art history is designed to be completed in four semesters.
Diagnostic Slide Examination
during the first week of their first semester, entering M.A. students take a diagnostic slide examination (dse). The purpose of the dse
is to identify one or more areas where the graduate student needs to develop visual knowledge beyond his or her undergraduate background. it is in no way punitive, nor is it graded. since the field of art history is increasingly global, and our program encourages a global approach, the diagnostic exam serves to assist the new graduate student in identifying an area in which he or she could increase his or her visual repertoire by auditing a survey class offered by one or more of the faculty.
Course Work
total of 12 courses, 36 credits.
Three required courses: Methods in Art Historical research (ArtH 850) in the first semester; Master’s Thesis writing seminar (ArtH 991) and Master’s Thesis (ArtH 993) in the fourth semester.
nine courses, of which five should be graduate research seminars (700-900-level).
in order to develop breadth of knowledge, both in terms of content and method, students must take at least two courses whose topics cover the time period before 1700 C.e. and two covering the period after 1700 C.e. Additionally, students must take courses with five different members of the graduate faculty.
Language Requirement
M.A. Degree: by the end of the third semester, all M.A. students are required to have met the language requirement of one language, other than english, appropriate to the area of study. The language will be determined in consultation with the student’s advisor, the director
of graduate studies, and the graduate committee. The student can demonstrate competency by obtaining a passing grade on the UnC– Chapel Hill reading competency exam, or earning a “b” (or a graduate “P”) or better in a fourth semester or higher language course, or earning a “b” (or a graduate “P”) in a literature course in that language at
UnC–Chapel Hill. note: no credit toward the M.A. course work requirement is given for language courses.
Master’s Exam
M.A. students take this exam at the beginning of their third semester. students who do not pass the exam at that time may re-take the exam at the end of the third semester. only students who have successfully passed the exam may register for ArtH 991 (Master’s Thesis writing seminar) or ArtH 993 (Master’s Thesis). The exam is offered only during the fall semester.
Master’s Thesis
The M.A. thesis is completed by the end of the fourth semester of enrollment. The completed thesis must be signed by the members of the thesis committee and submitted to The Graduate school in time for May graduation.
Doctor of Philosophy Degree
The degree of doctor of philosophy generally follows the requirements of The Graduate school as described in the section on graduate degree requirements in the Graduate School Handbook.
Course Work
Ph.d. students take a total of nine courses, at least four of which
are research seminars (900-level), plus a final course, ArtH 994 (doctoral dissertation). two of the nine courses may be taken in other departments as electives for supplementary and complimentary studies.
Electing to pursue an external minor: Ph.d. students may choose
to complete a formal external minor, which consists of at least three additional courses in a field related to his or her area of specialized study (such as communication studies, women’s studies, history, or medieval studies). The student must secure prior approval of the minor department, and a copy of the proposed courses to be taken must be signed by both departments and entered in the student’s permanent record in the department of Art and the UnC–Chapel Hill Graduate school.
Language Requirement
Ph.d. students are required to demonstrate proficiency in two languages (other than english). The first language will be the language that fulfilled the M.A. language requirement. The second language should be appropriate to the area of study, and will be determined in consultation with the student’s advisor, the director of graduate studies for art history, and the graduate committee. some fields require additional languages and students should study these languages as necessary. Competency in the second language will be determined following the same guidelines as those of the M.A. language requirement.
Preliminary Doctoral Exams
Ph.d. students take both the written and the oral preliminary exams during the semester after the Ph.d. course work is completed. Most Ph.d. students will take the preliminary exams during the spring semester of their second year in the Ph.d. program. Those students pursuing an external minor will take the preliminary exams during the fall semester of their third year.
• Written Exams. students take the written exams over the course of a one-week period. students who fail the written exams may repeat them only once. These exams are taken in three parts: first major field of study (six hours), second major field of study (six hours), methodological/thematic area of study (six hours).
• Preliminary Oral Exam. An oral exam will take place within two weeks of the written exam. The oral will be on the content of the written
Art 63
￼￼
64 www.UnC.edU/GrAdreCord
￼exams and may also include a defense of the dissertation prospectus. The examining committee will consist of at least three members who must be full-time active graduate faculty or adjunct teaching faculty in art history.
• Dissertation Prospectus. Ph.d. students defend their dissertation prospectus orally. if the dissertation prospectus is not defended at the oral exam, this defense should take place within four months of the written exams. At least two weeks before the prospectus defense, the student submits a dissertation prospectus to his or her dissertation committee, which should consist of five faculty members, three of whom must be permanent members of the UnC–Chapel Hill art history faculty.
Dissertation and Final Oral Exam
After passing the preliminary doctoral exams, the student begins work on the dissertation. once the dissertation is completed and approved by the advisor and dissertation committee, the student defends the finished dissertation. doctoral students have eight calendar years from the date of first registration in the doctoral program to complete the Ph.d. for doctoral students, there is a minimum residence credit requirement
of four semesters, and at least two semesters must be earned through continuous full-time registration on the UnC–Chapel Hill campus.
for further information the applicant should write to the director of graduate studies for art history.

The department of biochemistry and biophysics is an administrative division of the school of Medicine and a member of The Graduate school. The graduate program offers instruction and research opportunities leading to the Ph.d. degree. Although the department offers the M.s. degree, the graduate program is not designed as a terminal master’s curriculum. Applicants are offered admission with the expectation that they will complete their doctorate.
￼￼
Modern research in biochemistry and biophysics is designed to address mechanism and function; it utilizes the paradigms of molecular biology, but is influenced by chemistry, physics, and genetics. The philosophy
of the department and its graduate program is to provide students
with broad training in modern approaches to the field and unique opportunities for multidisciplinary training.
Curriculum
students are admitted to the graduate program through the bbsP portal, complete a minimum of three laboratory rotations, and then join the department of biochemistry and biophysics at the end of their first year. All students in the department are required to complete a seminar in biochemistry (bioC 701) or seminar in biophysics (bioC 704); bioC 712, which is a grant writing course designed to help prepare students for their comprehensive written examination; and bioC 715, which is a scientific presentation course. students are also required to complete nine credit hours in core courses and four credit hours of electives. further information on course requirements may be found at www.med.unc.edu/biochem/students/degree-requirements. students in the combined M.d./Ph.d. program are required to complete all course requirements.
The director of graduate studies advises entering students about course selection until the student chooses a research sponsor. students select research sponsors from the department’s primary and joint faculty members following the three laboratory rotations. After a research sponsor has been selected, a dissertation committee is formed to review the student’s yearly progress. The examinations required for admission to candidacy for the Ph.d. are administered as a comprehensive oral exam, a comprehensive written exam, and a final oral defense of a dissertation. The comprehensive oral exam (defense of the initial thesis proposal) will stress the dissertation proposal and related areas in an effort to ascertain the student’s understanding of the research project that he/she is undertaking. The comprehensive written examination will cover major topics in the areas of biochemistry and biophysics and cell and molecular biology. The most important requirement for the Ph.d. degree is a final oral defense of a dissertation or original research carried out independently by the candidate.
Financial Aid and Admissions
funds available from the University, the department, and individual research grants provide stipends for students. All applicants are considered for special fellowships and teaching or research assistantships. in recent years students received a stipend of $26,000 plus in-
state tuition and fees. Major medical insurance was also provided. nonresidents with predoctoral fellowships or assistantships are recommended for special tuition rates. Applications are considered from prospective graduate students who present evidence of superior scholarship in biology, chemistry, or biochemistry. The department recommends that students prepare themselves by taking general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics, and calculus. it is anticipated that students who have not had these courses will take them, as appropriate, after their arrival. departmental information may be obtained through the department’s web site: www.med.unc. edu/biochem. Applicants should apply online at gradschool.unc.edu/ admissions.
Research Interests
The faculty research interests are diverse and include research in the following areas: cell signaling and growth control, dnA repair and replication, membrane biophysics and function, molecular regulation including transcriptional control, nervous system development and function, and protein structure/function, including enzymology.
Model systems used by the faculty range from bacteria to mammals; techniques span molecular biology to physical biochemistry. A brochure describing the department and more detailed faculty research interests can be obtained by writing to the director of graduate studies of
the department of biochemistry and biophysics, or by visiting the department’s web site: www.med.unc.edu/biochem.
Facilities
The departmental research facilities are centered in the Genetic Medicine building, which is within walking distance of other medical school departments, research centers, and the departments of biology, chemistry, and physics. The building is equipped with instruments for molecular biological, biochemical, structural, and biophysical research. Animal care facilities are available to support the department’s research endeavors. research and training support is provided by several core facilities on campus. educational support is provided by the bbsP.

Modern biology, in this post-genome age, is being greatly enriched by an infusion of ideas from a variety of computational fields, including computer science, information science, mathematics, operations research, and statistics. in turn, biological problems are motivating innovations in these computational sciences. There is a high demand for scientists who can bridge these disciplines. The goal of the Curriculum in bioinformatics and Computational biology (bCb) is to train such scientists through a rigorous and balanced curriculum that transcends traditional departmental boundaries.
incoming students are expected to matriculate from a broad range
of disciplines; thus, it is important to ensure that all students have
a common foundation on which to build their bCb training. The
first year is dedicated to establishing this foundation and training all students with a common set of core bCb courses. bCb students will also participate in three laboratory research rotations their first year and ultimately join a lab at the end of those rotations. research work is done in the laboratory facilities of the individual faculty member and is supported primarily by faculty research grants.
Curriculum faculty have appointments in 18 departments in the school of Medicine, school of dentistry, school of Public Health, school of Pharmacy, school of information and library science, and the College of Arts and sciences. This level of diversity allows students a broad range of research opportunities.
Requirements for Admission for Graduate Work
ideal bCb candidates should have an undergraduate degree in a biological, physical, mathematical, or computational science. They must apply to the program through a unified application program known as the biological and biomedical sciences Program (bbsP). students apply for graduate study in the biological or biomedical sciences at UnC– Chapel Hill. students interested in any of the bbsP research areas apply to bbsP and those whose application portfolio places them highest on the admission list are asked to visit Chapel Hill for interviews. students who are ultimately admitted to UnC make no formal commitment to a Ph.d. program. After completing their first year of study students leave bbsP, join a thesis lab, and matriculate into one of 14 participating
￼￼
Ph.d. programs. during their first year bbsP students are part of small, interest-based groups led by several faculty members. These groups meet frequently and provide a research community for students until they join a degree-granting program. students are encouraged to apply as early as possible, preferably before december 1. (Applicants seeking a master’s degree are not considered for admission.)
Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
in addition to the dissertation requirements of The Graduate school (four full semesters of credit including at least six hours of doctoral dissertation, a written preliminary examination, an oral examination and a dissertation), students in the Curriculum in bioinformatics
and Computational biology must meet the following requirements: complete one or two foundational courses (as needed), complete all six of the bCb core courses, complete two elective courses (as determined by thesis advisor); participate in the bCb Colloquium as attendees the first and second years and as presenters in later years, act as teaching assistants for one of the bCb modules, attend the monthly seminar series sponsored by the Carolina Center for Genome sciences, and participate in the yearly bCb mini-symposium in the fall. students are required to rotate through at least three laboratories before choosing a thesis advisor. it is strongly recommended that students attend national meetings in order to better understand how their research fits with progress in their field.
financial Aid
stipends for predoctoral students are available from an niH predoctoral training grant and from the University. tuition, student fees, and graduate student health insurance are also covered by the training grant and the University.

￼granting program. in these groups students will develop professional skills including scientific writing and presentations, quantitative reasoning, and the ability to ask questions/solve problems based in the biological sciences. The faculty in these groups will serve as an advisory committee that will assist students in selecting courses that meet their individual interests.
bbsP students will be able to choose from more than 400 faculty members as they pursue three required research rotations in the fall and spring semesters of their first year. At the completion of the spring semester of the first year, each student will be asked to select an academic advisor who will provide guidance for his or her dissertation research training. The student will then join a Ph.d. program that the advisor is affiliated with and will complete course work requirements during the second year.
All students enrolled in the bbsP program receive an annual stipend ($27,500 in 2013). tuition, student fees, and health insurance are covered by the program.
Courses
The bbsP does not have a core curriculum or require students to take a particular set of courses beyond bbsP 901 and 902 (listed below). students may take courses offered by any of the participating Ph.d. programs (see individual program listings for available courses). After joining a specific Ph.d. program students must fulfill the specific coursework and other requirements of that program.

The department of biology offers a program of study leading to a doctor of philosophy degree in biology. Master’s degrees are generally only received by those students who have progressed far enough in the Ph.d. program, but cannot complete the program for various reasons. special departmental rules and guidelines for advanced degrees are available upon request.
Graduate Programs and Facilities
The department of biology is currently housed in four modern buildings. The newest building, the Genome sciences building, opened in July 2012. The department is equipped with modern instrumentation for research and research training in the diverse biological disciplines represented by the faculty. These include:
Genetics and Molecular Biology: Genetics is both a discipline (the study of heredity) and an experimental approach (manipulation of genes or the genetic material). today, most geneticists work at the molecular level by manipulating rnA,dnA or entire genomes. our group is strong
in both model organism genetics and genomics. Areas of emphasis include biochemistry and molecular biology, chromosome biology, developmental genetics, genomics, protein synthesis, enzyme mechanics, and plant genetics.
Cell Biology, Development, and Physiology: developmental biologists address the mechanisms through which cells acquire specialized functions to form complex body plans. These features are accomplished in part through cell proliferation, migration, and shape changes.
The department has a strong research program in these areas,
which are major topics in cell biology, as well as in other aspects of developmental biology. Areas of emphasis include cytology, mitotic
and meiotic mechanisms, histochemistry, experimental morphogenesis, morphogenetic movements, tissue culture, hormones, plant development, signal transduction, functional morphology, biomechanics and neuroethology, and membrane functions.
Evolutionary Biology: evolution is inherited change in the characteristics of populations over time. evolutionary biologists seek to explain the remarkable fit of organisms to their environment (adaptation), the origins of diversity, including the formation of new species (speciation), and the relationships among organisms. The department has a strong focus on the genetic and ecological mechanisms of adaptation and speciation.
Ecology: ecologists study how organisms interact with other organisms and with their physical environment. UnC’s group has strength in behavioral, conservation, community, disease, evolutionary, and marine ecology. Areas of emphasis include population biology, life histories, and ecosystem phenomena in diverse systems.
Behavior and Organismal Biology: organismal biologists seek
to understand the diversity of life forms on earth by analyzing organismal structure and function. UnC’s biology department takes an integrative approach to this research, combining analyses at levels ranging from molecules to whole organisms. The group a lso endeavors to understand the evolution and mechanisms of behavior. it uses theoretical, observational, and experimental approaches in a variety of species, from crawling behavior in sea slugs to communication in birds. Areas of emphasis include social and mating systems of vertebrates, communication, ecology and ontogeny of behavior, predator-prey interactions, marine ecology and oceanography, comparative physiology, neuroethology, functional morphology, and comparative biomechanics.
Plant Biology: The department has an active and diverse group that studies features specific to plants or that uses plant model systems to address questions of broad interest. Areas of emphasis include host- pathogen interactions, signal transduction, development, genomics, and chromosome biology.
After completing required course work in the department, students
in marine biology have access to the research facilities of the institute
of Marine sciences, Morehead City, north Carolina. by cooperative arrangements, deep water research can be carried out through the use of the research vessel of the duke University Marine laboratory.
inter-departmental degree programs in genetics, ecology, neurobiology, and marine sciences offer unusual opportunities for special training through participation of staff from the department of biology and many other departments in arts and sciences and health affairs.
UnC has a world-class library system including the Health science library which is dedicated to resources related to of biological research. A major research asset is the location of the University, which makes the varied flora and fauna of the Appalachian Mountains, Piedmont Plateau, Coastal Plain, and Atlantic Coast accessible for research and instruction. The department operates a small field station a few miles from the Chapel Hill campus in the Mason farm biological reserve, which includes several hundred acres of upland and floodplain habitats.
The Coker Arboretum and the north Carolina botanical Garden are
of value to students in the study of questions in plant biology. The Herbarium, containing more than 600,000 specimens, is especially rich in collections of the vascular plants and fungi of the Carolinas and the southeastern United states.
The Highlands biological station, administered for the University system by western Carolina University, is located in the biologically rich mountains at Highlands, north Carolina. Graduate courses offered cover various parts of the mountain biota. Credit may be obtained through UnC–Chapel Hill or western Carolina University. A limited amount of research support is available on a competitive basis. (see the annual announcement of the Highlands biological station.)
The University is a member of the organization for tropical studies (ots). financial support is available for students attend ing ots courses in tropical ecology in Costa rica.
Additional information about the graduate program including instructions for application is available at www.bio.unc.edu.
Fellowships and Assistantships
Applicants interested in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, development, or physiology should apply to the graduate program
via the biology and biomedical sciences Program (bbsP) application portal (www.med.unc.edu/bbsp/welcome.html). Applicants with an interest in evolutionary biology, ecology, behavior, or organismal biology should apply to the graduate program using UnC’s Graduate school

Application forms and a brochure containing detailed information about the program may be obtained by contacting the M.b.A. for executives Programs, Kenan–flagler business school, The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cb# 3490, McColl building, suite 3100, Chapel Hill, n.C. 27599-3490; (800) 453-9515; emba@unc. edu, www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/programs/emba.
Doctor of Philosophy
The Ph.d. program in business administration is designed for individuals who plan careers in research and teaching. A limited number of students are admitted each year, resulting in a high-quality learning environment that emphasizes rigor and personal attention. Although many students enter the program with an M.b.A., this degree is not
a requirement for admission. However, an M.b.A. from an accredited institution usually allows the student to waive some of the business fundamentals requirements. Prior to admission to the doctoral program, students are expected to have knowledge of elementary calculus and basic computer skills. A foreign language is not required for graduation
from the program. research and teaching assistantships are available on a competitive basis.
The requirements for the Ph.d. in business administration are:
• Business Fundamentals. All Ph.D. students are expected to possess
or to acquire a basic knowledge of accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior, and production. This requirement involves a level of competence roughly equivalent to the M.b.A. core courses on these topics. Most students entering with an M.b.A. or similar degree meet this requirement without additional course work. Appropriate courses will be recommended for students who do not meet this requirement prior to beginning the program.
• Economics. All Ph.D. students are expected to possess or to acquire knowledge of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory. The basic requirement is an M.b.A. or graduate-level course on each topic. once again, most students with an M.b.A. meet this requirement without additional course work. However, individual areas within the business school (e.g., finance) may require that students take specific courses after entering the program to meet this requirement. Appropriate courses will be recommended for students who do not meet this requirement prior to beginning the program.
• Research Methods/Quantitative Methodologies. All Ph.D. students are required to take five courses (fifteen hours) in research Methods/ Quantitative Methodologies. At least one course (three hours) must be a research methods course covering topics such as philosophy of science, research design, sample selection, etc. At least three of the courses (nine hours) must focus on quantitative methodologies such as statistics, operations research, econometrics, etc. The fifth course (three hours) may be a more specialized research methods course (e.g., survey research, lab experimentation) or another quantitative methodologies course.
• Major Area of Concentration. All Ph.D. students are required to declare a major area. The major area consists of six courses (eighteen hours). students may concentrate in one of the following areas:
• Accounting
• Operations
• Finance
• Organizational Behavior • Marketing
• Strategy and Entrepreneurship
These courses may be a combination of required courses offered within the major area, required courses offered outside of the major area, or approved elective courses.
• Supporting Area. All Ph.D. students are required to declare a supporting area. The supporting area consists of four courses (twelve hours). The supporting area allows the student to develop a strong expertise in an area related to the student’s research and teaching interests. These courses are usually drawn from a single area within the business school or from a specific outside department, but a student may assemble four courses from more than one area if the courses represent a coherent package.
• Research Paper. During the summer and fall following the first year, all Ph.d. students are required to complete a research paper. The paper must be evaluated and approved by the student’s faculty. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the student with important research experience and to develop research and writing skills. Most of these papers are later presented at professional meetings and many lead to
KenAn-flAGler bUsiness sCHool 87
￼￼
88 www.UnC.edU/GrAdreCord
￼publication. some papers develop into dissertations.
• Comprehensive Examination. All Ph.D. students must pass a
written comprehensive examination on the student’s major area of concentration and relevant material from the other requirements. students usually take this examination after completing course work, typically at the end of the second year. some areas may require an oral examination after completion of the written examination.
• Dissertation. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a dissertation prior to graduation from the program. The dissertation is a thorough theoretical and empirical investigation of a specific problem
important to the student’s major area. The dissertation’s value is in
its contribution to knowledge, in the scholarly manner in which it is organized and presented and in the demonstrated development of the student’s conceptual and research skills. before substantial work on the dissertation is undertaken, a written dissertation proposal must be presented and approved by the student’s dissertation committee. in most cases, the dissertation proposal is completed during the student’s third year in residence and the dissertation is completed during the fourth year.
• Teaching and Research. All students are required to serve as teaching assistants for at least one semester and as research assistants for at least one semester. students are also required to work with faculty prior to that semester on the development of their teaching skills.
Scholarships and Fellowships
Available to doctoral students in business administration are a number of assistantships. The school provides summer assistantships for doctoral students who receive awards from the University or the school during the academic year. once a doctoral student is awarded financial aid, the school generally provides support for eight semesters if the student is making satisfactory academic progress.
MBA@UNC – Online MBA Program Academics Overview
Program Format
Through the use of innovative technologies and real-world immersion experiences, MbA@UnC blends the flexibility of an online program with the rigor and quality of an on-campus experience. MbA@UnC
is structured so that faculty and classmates get to know one another in ways that shape the vibrant learning community that sets UnC Kenan- flagler apart.
World-Class Faculty and Curriculum
MbA@UnC leverages the same world-class faculty who teach in UnC Kenan-flagler’s other top-ranked MbA programs, and the curriculum is based on the curriculum delivered in those programs.
MbA@UnC is designed to provide aspiring leaders with the strong general management and leadership curriculum required to propel them to the next level in their careers. following a foundation of required core courses, MbA@UnC students can customize their studies by concentrating in one of six business disciplines.
Innovative Approach to Distance Learning
each course is designed and delivered by a UnC Kenan-flagler professor and requires:
• Preparation outside of class, including teamwork (texts, articles, cases, projects, papers). outside class, students can create sessions in exactly the same way as a professor does, and work together on the platform, seeing each other’s faces, working collaboratively on documents, creating video presentations, working on simulations together and so on.
• Lectures and delivery of new information (in an asynchronous format)
• Weekly virtual classes (in a synchronous format) in small groups (10- 15) led by faculty instructors (case discussions, role plays, breakout groups and other discussions to drive learning)
• Quarterly three-day immersion weekends. Students are responsible
for completing all coursework for the immersion weekends. Although they are only required to attend two over the duration of the program, we are finding that most students are attending as many as their schedules permit.

The department of Chemistry offers graduate programs leading to the degrees of master of arts, master of science (non-thesis), and doctor of philosophy in the fields of analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and polymer and materials chemistry. reinforcing the broad nature of our graduate program, we have close interactions with various departments including Physics, biochemistry, biological and biomedical sciences, and environmental science and engineering.
Doctor of Philosophy
The Ph.d. degree in chemistry is a research degree and students normally begin research during the first year in graduate school. As soon as the entering student has selected a research advisor, an advisory committee is established to develop an appropriate course of study designed to meet individual needs. The Ph.d. degree consists of completion of a suitable program of study, a preliminary doctoral oral examination, a written comprehensive examination that is satisfied by cumulative examinations, an original research project culminating in a dissertation, and a final oral examination.
Master of Arts
The Master of Arts degree requires a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit. The student’s advisory committee determines courses. A written comprehensive examination (which may be satisfied by cumulative examinations), a thesis, and a final oral examination are also required. Admission to the Ph.d. program after completion of the M.A. degree in the department requires approval by the Chemistry Graduate studies Committee.
￼￼
Master of Science (non-thesis)
The Master of science (non-thesis) degree requires a minimum of thirty semester hours. The candidate must earn at least 24 hours of graduate credit in chemistry and allied subjects, which may include graduate seminars numbered 700 or higher but may not include CHeM 921, 931, 941, 951, 961, and 981 (referred to collectively as “9X1”). As
a substitute for the thesis, the candidate must earn a minimum of three hours of CHeM 992 (master’s non-thesis option). The student’s advisory committee determines the student’s program of study. A written report submitted to the student’s research director describing work done while registered for CHeM 992 and a written examination (which may be satisfied by cumulative examinations) are also required. Admission to the Ph.d. program after completing the M.s. degree in the department requires approval by the Chemistry Graduate studies Committee.

City and Regional Planning
The state of north Carolina, the research triangle region, and the community of Chapel Hill are ideally suited to serve as the home base of
a nationally ranked program in city and regional planning. The UnC– Chapel Hill campus is 30 miles west of raleigh, the state capital and
the location of many agencies of state government. Through research projects, internships, and workshop courses, faculty and students interact with agencies such as Commerce, Community development, labor, environmental and natural resources, transportation, the board of science and technology, and the north Carolina Housing finance Agency.
The 5,600-acre research triangle Park, which boasts more than 40 large research facilities employing more than 30,000 people, is only
10 miles from campus. The park, which symbolizes the style of high- tech economic development emerging in many growing regions in
the United states, is one of the primary engines driving the area’s growth. The raleigh/durham metropolitan area, of which research triangle Park and Chapel Hill are part, has been identified as one of 30 metropolitan areas in the country that accounted for half of the new jobs in the nation. north Carolina, the nation’s 10th most populous state, is growing by about 1.5 percent a year. The research triangle area is growing three times as fast. The future urbanization patterns of other areas are evident in the research triangle area.
The department of City and regional Planning (dCrP) at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill was established in 1946.
it was among the first seven planning education programs in the United states. The original bases of the department and its program were ideas about regionalism, broad-scale development planning, and the application of social science methods to practical problems of government being explored on the Chapel Hill campus in the 1930s and 1940s. This was the first planning department to be established with its principal university base in the social sciences, rather than in landscape design, architecture, or engineering. The department has retained and strengthened that social science legacy through its faculty’s multidisciplinary research and teaching programs.
At the start of the program in 1946, planning was defined as “the union of modern social science, design, and engineering. it utilizes social science techniques to analyze the adjustments between people and their physical environment, and adjustments among people in their efforts to meet human needs. Through the planning process, ways and means of meeting these needs are developed through social organization and the application of design and engineering techniques.”
from an original concern for applications of social science to regional development needs, the department has broadened its scope to include urban, state, and community planning and to cover physical, social, economic, and natural environmental concerns. The implementation and management aspects of planning—carrying out public policy through programs, projects, budgeting and finance, regulatory controls, and other actions—are also emphasized.
The concept of development as a goal of planning remains central to the department’s mission. whether the objectives are improved physical, social, economic, or environmental conditions or more efficient
and equitable policies and programs, planning is a way to effectively marshal resources to achieve public development objectives. The professional planner combines an understanding of urban and regional theory grounded in a spatial context with a grasp of the planning and management methods necessary to guide development toward desired goals. These skills have taken on added importance with the emergence
￼￼
of expanded state and local responsibilities and increased public-private development ventures.
Graduates of the program apply their professional knowledge as local and regional planners, private consultants, public interest group staff members, nonprofit development organization planners, and state and federal government officials. to be an effective professional in these varying contexts requires a continuously updated knowledge base; therefore, the practitioner must be supported by active researchers. Thus, the overall mission of the department is twofold: to educate practitioners and researchers capable of leadership in planning and to expand the frontiers of knowledge about the effects of public and private actions on development processes through faculty research and service.
Degrees Offered
The department offers two degrees: the master of city and regional planning (M.C.r.P.) and the doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.) in
planning. The two-year master’s degree program prepares students for the professional practice of planning. The Ph.d. program prepares students for careers in research and university teaching in planning. The requirements of the two programs are described in detail in subsequent sections of the catalog. The two graduate degree programs are largely independent. Applicants should indicate which program they wish to enter.
Facilities and Equipment
The department of City and regional Planning is housed in new east. new east contains microcomputer laboratories, lecture and seminar rooms, and offices. Mainframe and additional microcomputer facilities and a geographic information systems laboratory are available to students through the odum institute for research in social science and through the UnC–Chapel Hill Computation Center.
Students in the Department
during the past 60 years students have entered the department from all parts of the United states, Canada, and many other countries. The educational backgrounds of alumni who now hold positions of responsibility in the profession cover a wide range of undergraduate fields. Among them are architecture, biology, botany, business, economics, engineering, forestry, geography, history, landscape architecture, philosophy, political science, public policy analysis, psychology, public administration, sociology, and urban studies.
Graduates hold positions as directors of planning in the planning departments of small and large cities and as directors of state and regional planning programs. Graduates work as associate and assistant planners in city, county, metropolitan, and regional planning agencies; in housing and urban development agencies; in various branches of the federal service; in community-based organizations and associations; in research organizations; and in private development firms and banks. finally, graduates are also employed as private consultants; as planning advisors to communities and developing areas; and as deans, chairs, and faculty members of educational institutions.
The Planning Profession and Employment Opportunities
during the past 30 years the field of planning has expanded considerably. The planning function remains a central part of municipal, county, and state government. Planning agencies operate within the framework of metropolitan, regional, and national governmental programs. Planning expertise is now essential in nonprofit and community-based development organizations, consulting firms, advocacy groups, and other private organizations.
This period of increasing planning activity has broadened the scope of planning. in addition to design, research, and analysis, present-day
planning functions include program management and implementation activities within public agencies and private organizations, as well as coordination between government and business. Planners are increasingly called upon to lead analysis teams, to mediate conflicts, to advise decision makers of project impacts, and to package development proposals.
employment opportunities in planning are varied. in general the work involves collection and processing of data; physical, environmental, and socioeconomic analysis; the preparation and evaluation of alternative proposals; and the formulation and implementation of programs for action.
As a consequence of the growth of planning activities throughout the world, adequately trained and qualified members of the profession are in demand in this country and abroad.
equally important to the advancement of the field is the increasing need for advancing theory and knowledge in urban and regional development and for motivated teachers of planning. There has been a steadily increasing demand for teachers and researchers among universities and research organizations in the United states, Canada, and overseas.
together with the faculty, hundreds of the department’s 1,800 alumni in all parts of the country form an effective job referral and placement network for new and old graduates alike. large numbers of our graduates in such key metropolitan centers as boston, new york, the district of Columbia, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, and on the west Coast provide invaluable assistance to students in their initial job searches and throughout their professional careers. Alumni keep in touch with the department and each other through the alumni listserv and the alumni newsletter, which the department publishes and distributes annually to all graduates.

The normal course load is 12 to 15 credit hours per semester. Thirty-nine of the required 51 credits must be taken in the City and regional Planning department.
Course work for the degree is divided into general requirements, area of specialization and electives. each student is assisted by a faculty advisor in designing an educational program. The advisor helps select courses appropriate for the student’s educational interests and goals.
General Course Requirements
All master’s degree students are expected to meet certain general course requirements. These consist of courses covering planning theory,
urban spatial theory, applied microeconomics, analytical methods, communications skills, law and a planning workshop. These basic course topics constitute a core of knowledge and skills prerequisite to completion of the master’s degree program.
The planning theory requirement is met by completing PlAn 704.
The analytical methods requirement is met by completing PlAn 720. PlAn 714 fulfills the spatial theory requirement. The economics requirement is met by completing PlAn 710. All students are required to take a law course. There are many ways to fulfill this requirement. The department offers PlAn 724 (law for Planners) once a year. students should consult with their advisors and instructors in other programs (e.g., lAw and MbA) to ensure that they can enroll in specific courses. students select a planning workshop (PlAn 823) during their second year. in addition, most students take a planning law course appropriate for their specialization.
Areas of Specialization
each student develops an area of specialization in planning in consultation with faculty advisors. The area of specialization identifies the fields of professional practice in which the student expects to develop competence and begin a professional career.
Areas of specialization offered by the department reflect a combination of current practice, employment opportunities, available faculty resources, and longer-term societal needs. As these factors change, specialization content is adjusted. specialization offers different blends of technical knowledge, planning and management skills, philosophies about the role of the planner, and theories for understanding relevant problems and contexts.
The department offers five specializations associated with professional planning practice in community development, design and preservation, economic development, land use and environmental planning, and transportation planning. sustainable development is the overarching concept for these specializations. each emphasizes equity, environmental quality, economic viability and social participation and grapples with the interconnections among these dimensions of sustainability.
• Economic Development focuses on planning for functional and sustainable regional economies and issues of income and jobs for central city areas.
• Housing and Community Development is concerned with
the supply of affordable housing, the revitalization of urban neighborhoods, project development, and central city redevelopment.
• Land Use and Environmental Planning addresses growth management at the urban and regional scales, environmental management, and policy analysis with emphasis on water resources.
• Placemaking and Real Estate Development focuses on planning, design, preservation, and redevelopment of the city as a physical entity.
• Transportation Planning provides concepts and tools relevant to transportation policy and planning and in-depth knowledge of the reciprocal relationship between transportation decisions and land development.
students with a special interest in areas of the developing world may take a formal minor in planning for developing areas, in addition to their area of specialization. The minor is designed to train planners from both industrialized and less developed countries to work on management, research, administrative, and planning issues at the local, regional, and national levels in developing areas. Theories of
￼
economic development, social change, environmental degradation, and urbanization are presented, as well as analytical tools and quantitative techniques that prepare students to embark on a variety of careers
that meet the needs of donor agencies and governments in developing countries. students receive training in cost-benefit analysis and project appraisal, project management, and population planning.
it is also possible for master’s students in city and regional planning to take a formal minor in public policy analysis within the structure of the M.C.r.P. curriculum.
Generally, specialization courses account for 15 credit hours. Thus, in the 51-credit-hour program, about two-thirds of the credits fulfill basic requirements or specialization requirements, while the rest are electives chosen by the student in consultation with faculty advisors.
General Electives
Additional courses are required beyond the general required courses and courses in the area of specialization. General electives may be used to
1) complement and support the area of specialization, 2) specialize in another area of professional planning, 3) develop skills in a discipline (e.g., economics, design, management) or another professional
program represented on campus (e.g., public administration, health administration, environmental engineering, or business), or 4) develop general competence for professional practice through courses selected both within the department and from the regular offerings of the University. Up to 12 credits may be taken outside the department.
domestic and international contexts. The program is small but highly selective and individualized. it is ideal for mature students from a variety of backgrounds.
The Ph.d. degree requires a minimum of 30 credits. A master’s degree in planning is not required, although most doctoral students have previous graduate work in planning or a related field. students must fulfill four semesters of residence. The department accepts graduate transfer credits but requires at least one year of continuous residency of at least six semester hours per regular semester. The department does not require
a foreign language. it strongly encourages both research and teaching experience during residency.
in practice, doctoral candidates who hold master’s degrees in planning or a related field generally require three to four semesters of formal course work in residence before beginning the dissertation. other candidates may require five or more semesters, depending on their preparation. dissertation research generally takes an additional year.
each student develops an individualized course of study to reflect a specific area of interest and career aspirations. Areas of specialization and appropriate course work are determined jointly by the student and program advisor. Programs are designed to meet the student’s needs and build on prior academic training, for which substantial departmental
or University faculty resources are available. Courses in the area of specialization must be mutually reinforcing and coherent; must prepare the student for expertise in some body of knowledge, methodology,
or problem area; and must provide the student with the methods and knowledge base to do scholarly research. The comprehensive exams, taken at the end of course work, require a knowledge of planning theory and research methods (in addition to the student’s specific area of specialization).
A student may take a formal minor in another discipline with the consultation and approval of the appropriate department and the student’s program committee. The minor emphasizes the achievement of methodological and related skills necessary to extend the student’s research capabilities within a chosen area of specialization. supportive complementary relationships between the two program components must be demonstrated.
it is important that the Ph.d. Admissions Committee be able to identify an applicant’s program interests from application materials submitted for review to The Graduate school and to the department.
in addition to any supplemental material the applicant may wish to submit in support of the application, the statement called for in the department’s supplemental application should describe the proposed area of concentration and specific program course work and research interests, and provide information on relevant prior academic and professional training. The admissions process consists of two related phases. first, the Admissions Committee renders judgment about the academic qualifications of the Ph.d. applicant. second, if academic qualifications are met, the committee attempts to identify the applicant’s program interests and the stage of development of those interests, and then considers the extent to which departmental and University-wide resources may be marshaled in support of those stated interests. Thus, academic qualifications are necessary but are not the only basis for admission into the doctoral program. Applicant interests must be clear and University resources must be supportive to ensure the development of a strong Ph.d. program.
Persons wishing to be considered for admission to the doctoral program and for fellowships and assistantships that may be available to doctoral candidates are advised to communicate with the department as far in advance as possible of the date they wish to enter. while the University financial awards are made in the spring semester each year, the deadline

The master’s project required of all master’s degree students is original work involving substantial independent research and analysis of a topic related to planning practice. The requirement may be met by a paper of standard format. The requirement can also be fulfilled with a product in some other form, such as a plan or audiovisual presentation. ordinarily students submit an individually prepared paper. The student submits the paper topic and outline to the director of the student’s focus area. The director approves the topic and assigns a faculty member to serve
as major advisor for the project. The student may invite another faculty member to serve as a reader. both must approve the final project. The project is completed during the final semester in residence and is filed by the department as part of the permanent record of the student’s work.
The Doctoral Program
The doctoral program in planning provides training in research methods, planning theory and areas of specialization that enable graduates to contribute to the development of substantive theory, knowledge and scholarship in planning; to formulate and evaluate innovative public policy; and to administer research programs in

Dual Degree Programs
Program in Law and Planning
Under a dual-degree program sponsored by the school of law and the department of City and regional Planning, students may pursue the J.d. and M.C.r.P. degrees together. taken concurrently, the two degrees may be obtained in four years rather than the five years ordinarily required. The program seeks to develop professionals capable of
dealing with both the legal and planning aspects of urban and regional development and policy. Course work is designed to prepare students for a variety of professional roles in which knowledge of planning methodology and process, coupled with the analytical skills and professional expertise of the lawyer, are essential. Graduates join private law firms, consulting firms, and public legal and planning staffs.
to enter this program, students must apply separately to the school of law and to the department of City and regional Planning, and must be accepted independently by both. students entering the program spend their entire first year in either the planning department or the law school, and students must make this choice at the time of admission. The second year is normally spent full-time in the program not selected in the first year. After the first two years, the student has an additional 43 semester credits to complete in the law school and 12 semester credits to complete in planning.

Program in Business and Planning
The Kenan–flagler business school and the department of City
and regional Planning offer a dual-degree program leading to the M.b.A. and M.C.r.P. degrees, usually in three years. The program builds management and planning skills that enable graduates to
pursue rewarding, flexible, and socially useful careers in the private, nonprofit, or public sectors. Graduates work in real estate and economic development consulting, financial institutions, and entrepreneurial firms. increasingly, applicants to the business and planning program want to pursue career paths that combine planning and management and seek the flexibility to move between jobs in the public and private sectors.
to enter this program, students must apply separately to both the department of City and regional Planning and the Kenan–flagler business school, and must be accepted independently by both. students entering the program spend their entire first year in either the planning department or the business school. The second year is spent full-time
in the other program. in the third year, students take courses in both business and planning. sufficient electives can be taken in planning and business so that a curriculum can be tailored to each student’s career objectives. Admission to the business school is based on demonstrated potential for responsible leadership, the quality of the student’s academic transcripts, and the applicant’s score on the Graduate Management Admission test (GMAt), administered by the educational testing service of Princeton, nJ.

Program in Public Administration and Planning
Planners often gravitate to management positions in local and state government that require knowledge of budgeting, personnel, and government administration and politics. City and county managers grapple with planning and development issues, which constitute a large portion of local government agendas. This dual-degree program prepares professionals who want the flexibility of moving between planning and management positions in government. The department and the Public Administration program in the school of Government collaborate to enable students to receive both the M.C.r.P. and the M.P.A. degrees
in three years, plus a summer professional field experience in public administration.
The intent of the combined program is to ensure that students have two complete and complementary, but distinct, areas of training. The M.P.A. requirements ensure adequate training in public management. The M.C.r.P. requirements ensure adequate training in core planning knowledge and skills, and in an area of planning specialization.
students must obtain admission to both the M.P.A. and M.C.r.P. programs independently. with prior approval from faculty advisors in both programs, students may then count certain courses toward both degrees. The combined program requires a total of 75 semester credit hours. students are advised to gain approval from faculty advisors for their specific program of courses during the first semester of residence to ensure that they can meet all requirements of both programs within three years.

Program in Public Health and Planning
The intellectual, professional, and historical connections between public health and city planning have assumed new urgency in the 21st century, as the challenges of chronic illness, urban livability, and public safety have come to the fore. The built environment is increasingly seen as an important factor influencing physical activity, which in turn has positive impacts on health promotion and disease prevention. The growth
and redevelopment of urban areas impact public health and safety in many ways. it is important to reconnect the public health and urban planning fields through professional training that will encourage greater connections in professional practice.
The department of City and regional Planning and the school of Public Health have three dual degree programs to facilitate the
￼
reconnection of the professions. dual programs exist with the department of Health behavior and Health education (HbHe), environmental sciences and engineering (ese), and Health Policy and Management (HPM). to enter these programs, students must apply separately to the department of City and regional Planning and the departments in the school of Public Health, and must be accepted independently by both. students entering the program spend their entire first year either in sPH or dCrP. The second year is spent full- time in the other program. in the third year, students take both public health and planning courses. students should be able to complete both programs in three years (instead of four years). students are expected
to complete master’s projects or other capstone requirements for each department at the end of the program that demonstrate mastery of the two fields and an understanding of the interconnections between the fields.
The department of City and regional Planning offers the master of city and regional planning degree (M.C.r.P.).
The departments in the sPH offer the following degrees:
• HBHE: Master of public health (M.P.H.)
• ESE: Master of public health (M.P.H.), master of science (M.S.), master of science in environmental engineering (M.s.e.e.), and master of science in public health (M.s.P.H.).
• HPAA: Master of public health (M.P.H.), master of science in public health (M.s.P.H.), and master of healthcare administration (M.H.A.).

Program in Landscape Architecture and Planning
The dual-degree program in landscape architecture and planning strengthens the design dimension of the planning curriculum, and creates a venue for working closely with the College of design at
north Carolina state University. The department of landscape Architecture offers two graduate program tracks leading to the master
of landscape architecture (M.l.A.), both of which emphasize creative problem solving and a long-term commitment to responsible design. The curriculum provides the professional skills needed to deal with
the human and natural forces that shape the land. The department is especially concerned with the protection, restoration, enhancement, and regeneration of the natural and cultural environments in urban, rural, and wilderness settings.
to enter this program, students apply to each department separately and must gain admission to both. The amount of time required for the M.l.A. will depend on whether the student is pursuing the first Professional degree track (82 credits) or Advanced studies track (42 credits). Usually, students will be able to reduce the time needed
to attain both the M.C.r.P. and the M.l.A. by about one year by taking course work in each department that counts toward the other department’s degree program.

Program in Civil Engineering
A dual degree program is under development with the department of Civil engineering at north Carolina state University.
Students in Other Departments
students taking degrees in other departments may be admitted to courses in city and regional planning provided they have the necessary prerequisite training and permission of the instructor. Courses are also open to undergraduate students. Priority is given to students minoring in urban studies and planning.
Research Programs in Urban and Regional Studies
Through the Center for Urban and regional studies, the odum institute for research in social science, the water resources research institute, the institute for environmental studies, the Carolina Population Center, and the institute for economic development, members of the faculty and graduate students in the department of City and regional Planning and in related departments collaborate on research in a wide range of subject areas concerning planning, human behavior, and the environment.
established in 1953 and later expanded under a grant from the ford foundation, the program of the Center for Urban and regional studies is concerned with theoretical and empirical research in urban processes and area development. The center has a permanent staff for planning and administration of its program and for the development of an interdisciplinary research-oriented program of services to local and state governments in north Carolina and elsewhere. The department’s faculty use the center to pursue research interests and collaborate with faculty members of other University departments on research projects.
in 1964 the water resources research institute was established to support research on all aspects of water resources, including the planning, programming, and analysis of urban and regional systems for development and control of quantity and quality of water and related land use. The institute serves as a focal point for faculty and student research and interdisciplinary seminars relating to water resources.
The Carolina Population Center (CPC), established in 1966, provides coordination of the University-wide interdisciplinary program in population research and training. The center provides population research services to faculty doing research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences in the United states and abroad. departmental faculty and students are engaged in international research through the CPC.
The institute for economic development was created in 1971 within
the extension division of the University to sponsor the basic economic development course. now under the auspices of the department of City and regional Planning, the institute promises to strengthen the department’s research and teaching mission and to enlarge its service capacity.

￼The Highway safety research Center (HsrC) is dedicated to improving transportation safety, with a major emphasis on highway safety. The center conducts basic and applied research that increases knowledge and contributes to reducing death, injury, and related societal costs. HsrC works to translate developed knowledge into practical interventions
that can be applied at local, state, national, and international levels. HsrC conducts research in the three major areas of the highway safety problem—the driver/occupant, the vehicle, and the roadway. HsrC produces guidebooks, brochures, how-to manuals, news releases, public service announcements, and newsletters to communicate highway safety information to research colleagues, safety advocates, government officials, and motorists.
in addition to these activities organized under an institute or center, faculty members are engaged in research projects administered by the department.
several other facilities in the nearby research triangle Park enrich and support the department’s teaching and research programs:
The research triangle institute (rti) is a not-for-profit corporation that conducts research under contract to departments of federal, state, and local governments; public service agencies; foundations; and industry clients ranging from local firms to national corporations.
rti was created as a separately operated affiliate of the three major universities that form the research triangle. initial start-up funding for rti was provided through a grant from the research triangle foundation.
The institute is organized into major groups whose areas of capability span social and economic systems and human resources, statistical sciences, survey research, chemistry and life sciences, energy, engineering, and environmental sciences.
The environmental research Center of the U.s. environmental Protection Agency (ePA), the largest field installation of the ePA, was dedicated in december 1971. today it is an international center of scientific expertise in environmental research.
The triangle Universities Center for Advanced studies, incorporated (tUCAsi) represents an additional effort in the research triangle to capitalize on the presence in a small radius of three major doctoral- research institutions, their facilities, libraries, and auxiliary resources. tUCAsi is a joint activity of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, duke University in durham, and north Carolina state University in raleigh. tUCAsi is the parent body that sponsors development of advanced study enterprises on its 120-acre campus within the research triangle Park. The center, chartered in 1975,
is governed by a board of trustees, representing the constituent universities, the research triangle foundation, and elected members.
The national Humanities Center (nHC) was the first resident activity on the tUCAsi campus. The center opened in 1978 as an institute for advanced study in history, literature, philosophy, and other fields of the humanities. each year, approximately 45 leading scholars
from the United states and other nations come to nHC to pursue individual research and engage in interdisciplinary seminars, lectures, and conferences. Their work results in books, articles, and other contributions to learning. Grants from major foundations, corporations, the national endowment for the Humanities, the major universities in the triangle, and individuals support the center’s program funding and administrative costs.
The UnC institute for transportation research and education
(itre) is a division of the University of north Carolina General Administration. its responsibilities include facilitation of transportation-
related programs throughout the 17 UnC system campuses. Affiliated faculty and staff of itre are located on various campuses of the University system and at itre’s research triangle Park facilities. included among itre’s activities are workshops, short courses, research projects, and training programs for transportation professionals throughout north Carolina.

￼laboratories and industry. Academic employment ranges from four-year colleges, where teaching is the primary focus, to positions at major research universities. The M.s. program prepares highly competent and broadly skilled practitioners. A majority of the master’s graduates work in industry, in companies ranging from small start-up operations to government labs and large research and development corporations.
Most of the department’s approximately 150 graduate students are full- time. students contribute to nearly every aspect of the department’s operation. in addition to taking a wide variety of courses, they participate in groundbreaking research, teach, attend research group meetings, and can serve on committees that affect all aspects of life in the department.
The Computer science students Association sponsors both professional and social events and represents the students in departmental matters. its president is a voting member at faculty meetings.
Facilities
The department of Computer science is housed in two adjacent buildings, the frederick P. brooks Jr. Computer science building and J. Carlyle sitterson Hall. These two buildings are connected by hallways on all floors so that they function as a single, larger building.
The brooks building was dedicated in 2008 and named for the department’s founding chair, frederick P. brooks Jr. it opened up 32,000 square feet of new research space, offices, and classrooms. These include a 50-seat classroom; the stephen f. weiss seminar room, with seating for 20 around a table; the registrar’s classroom, with theater seating for 80; and the faculty Conference room, which seats 50 at tiers of curved desktops. Meetings or discussion groups take place in
the chair’s conference room and in five smaller meeting areas, each
with projectors. Perhaps the most striking area of the building is the new noise-controlled graphics lab, which is divided into three areas by floor-to- ceiling blackout curtains for light and sound suppression. it has 11-foot ceilings and a unistrut mounting grid to mount hardware as needed.
sitterson Hall, which opened in 1987 and is named for former University Chancellor J. Carlyle sitterson, provides 74,000 square feet of sophisticated, state-of-the-art research facilities and office space.
it is organized in “clusters” to create research communities featuring shared laboratories and open conference areas to facilitate interaction among students and faculty. included are the 60-seat C. Hugh Holman video teleclassroom, named for the former provost and dean of The Graduate school who was instrumental in establishing this department; a 125-seat auditorium; the lib Moore Jones Classroom, named for
the department’s first secretary; a reading room; and various research laboratories, conference areas, and study areas.
Graduate students have access to all of the department’s research and teaching facilities, including specialized research laboratories for graphics and image processing, computer building and design, and collaborative, distributed, and parallel systems. The laboratories, offices, conference areas, and classrooms are bound together by the department’s fully integrated, distributed computing environment.
General Computing Environment
The department’s computing environment includes over 1,000 computers, ranging from older systems used for generating network traffic for simulated internet experiments to state-of-the-art workstations and clusters for graphics- and compute-intensive research. departmental servers provide compute service, disk space, email, Cvs (version control software), web service, database services, backups, and many other services. All systems are integrated by means of high-speed networks and are supported by a highly skilled technical staff that provides a consistent
computing environment throughout the department. Most students are assigned to a two- or three-person office, though we also have one larger office that can hold 11 students. each student is assigned a computer, with computer assignments based on the students’ research or teaching assignments and their seniority within the department. in addition to the departmental servers and office systems, our research laboratories contain a wide variety of specialized equipment and facilities.
General computing systems include 800+ intel-based computers plus about 50 Macintosh systems. The department’s most powerful system is the biomedical Analysis and simulation supercomputer (bAss, pronounced like base), which consists of 452 CPUs tightly coupled to each other and to 180 GPU computing processors that function as image and geometry calculation accelerators, providing the equivalent computing power of more than 13,000 processors for image-intensive applications.
our systems primarily run the windows 7 operating system, with some still running windows XP and a smaller number of systems, including many of the servers, running red Hat linux. we have other flavors of linux as well, including some desktops and servers running Ubuntu and fedora. in addition, a large number of network research systems run freebsd. we use the Afs file system for central file storage. languages most commonly used include J++, C++, Java, and C. document preparation is usually accomplished with standard applications on PC systems. our extensive software holdings are continually evolving.
Libraries
students have access to the entire University library system, which includes a major academic affairs library and numerous satellite libraries containing more than 6,000,000 books and periodicals, and access to libraries at north Carolina state, duke, and north Carolina Central universities with a unified online searching capability. The brauer library, located in adjacent Phillips Hall, is a satellite library with extensive holdings in computer science, mathematics, operations research, physics, and statistics.
Degree Requirements
Graduate Curriculum
A flexible course of study for the M.s. and Ph.d. degrees focuses on areas of choice and accommodates differences in students’ backgrounds. The two degree programs share a basic distribution requirement
chosen from theory and formal thinking, systems and hardware,
and applications subject areas. The Ph.d. program includes work in specialized areas, preparation for teaching, and active involvement in advanced research.
Master of Science
An M.s. candidate must earn 30 semester hours of credit in courses numbered 400 or higher, of which up to six hours may be transferred from another institution or graduate program, and of which 18
hours must be completed in the Computer science department. A candidate must also satisfy the program product requirement and
must demonstrate the ability to write a professional-quality technical document. A comprehensive exam (written or oral) is required for degree completion. for more in-depth information see www.cs.unc.edu/ cms/academics/graduate-programs/mastersreqofficial.
Doctor of Philosophy
Admission to the doctoral program is by a vote of the department faculty and is determined by performance on the preliminary research presentation and exam, course grades, admissions information, accomplishment on assistantships, and other testimony from the faculty. Admission is normally considered following the research presentation
￼
and exam. students who have been major contributors to a paper submitted to a well-known, refereed conference or journal may apply for a waiver of the admissions exam. There is no credit hour requirement
for the Ph.d. program, but a Ph.d. candidate must complete courses
to satisfy the distribution requirement and any needed background preparation, and must write a comprehensive paper. A candidate must also satisfy the program product requirement, teach a course, participate in the technical communication seminar, pass an oral examination in the proposed dissertation area, and submit and defend a dissertation that presents an original contribution to knowledge. The normal time needed to complete the degree by a full-time student with an assistantship is
five years. for more in-depth information see www.cs.unc.edu/cms/ academics/graduate-programs/doctoralreqofficial.
Admissions and Financial Aid
Admission to the department is highly competitive and preference is given to applicants who are solidly prepared. Although the department welcomes promising students from all disciplines, entering students must have a substantial background in both mathematics and computer science. This background normally includes at least six semester courses in mathematics and six in computer science. students who are admitted but who have not completed all the requirements must complete them after admission. for more in-depth information on the admissions process see www.cs.unc.edu/cms/admissions/admissions-graduate- programs/admitreq and gradschool.unc.edu/admissions/.
Sponsorship. because of the large number of applicants, the department’s faculty members are unable to provide individual assessments of an applicant’s chances for admission. Applicants cannot improve their chances of admission by finding a faculty sponsor within the department, because all admissions decisions are made by a faculty committee that reviews all applications, ranks the applicants by overall merit, and makes decisions on admission and financial support based on the application material submitted. students are assigned to specific research projects just prior to the start of each semester, after faculty members and students have had an opportunity to meet and to discuss their interests.
deadlines. Applicants for fall admission are encouraged to submit
all application materials, complete with a personal statement, all transcripts and recommendations to The Graduate school by January 1. to ensure meeting that deadline, applicants are encouraged to take the Graduate record examination (Gre) no later than december 1. early submission of applications is encouraged. international applicants should complete their applications earlier to allow time for processing financial and visa documents.
for more information, send electronic mail to admit@cs.unc.edu. interested persons are encouraged to visit the department’s web site, www.cs.unc.edu.

Oral Biology
oral biology is a highly translational, multi-disciplinary program of study that focuses on the growth, development, and pathologies of the craniofacial complex and associated physiological structures, as well as the study of disease and healing mechanisms related to these structures. The program has three concentrations:
• Host-Pathogen Interactions
• Pain Neurobiology
• Skeletal Biology and Extracellular Matrices
The discipline of oral biology applies and extends the concepts of immunology, embryology, physiology, cellular and molecular biology, neurobiology, pharmacology, microbiology, and biochemistry to understanding the growth and development and pathologies associated with the craniofacial complex and oral cavity. Attention in dental research and practice is now focusing on the dynamics of oral disease and prevention and treatment at the earliest stages of development, including research on risk factors for disease as well as the cellular and molecular events in disease pathogenesis. Molecular approaches for oral disease analysis and the complexity of disease elements require advanced training in the discipline of oral biology. Modern biomedical research is also identifying systemic relationships between oral conditions, health status, and diseases such as atherosclerosis, Hiv, and cancer; the oral cavity also offers an ideal model to study biological structures and cellular mechanisms important throughout the body and important in immune response.
The Concentration in Host-Pathogen interactions focuses on chronic inflammatory conditions and encompasses the study of infectious diseases and host responses. This concentration focuses on the underlying pathologies associated with infectious diseases, as well
as the nature and regulation of host responses which result in acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, in order to develop therapeutic approaches to the treatment of these conditions. The Concentration
in Pain neurobiology encompasses a translational approach to
study maladaptive pain conditions. This concentration integrates genetics, molecular biology, animal models, psychophysical testing, neuroimaging, and clinical epidemiological approaches to better understand the mechanisms driving chronic pain as well as to identify unique markers for diagnosis and treatment. The Concentration in skeletal biology and extracellular Matrices encompasses the study of the development, structure and function of mineralized and connective tissues. This program uses basic, translational, and biomedical engineering approaches to the study of bone, tooth and connective tissue physiology, pathology and repair.
expertise and authority in these particular concepts are well-represented within the research and training qualifications of program faculty located in numerous UnC programs and departments, including the school of dentistry, school of Medicine, lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, the neurosciences Center, the Center for Cystic fibrosis, and the Center for Aids research.
Curricular requirements are based on training areas, with common core requirements for all students. research interests and qualifications will also determine course requirements. research is a key element of the program, and students start laboratory rotations during their first semester to allow maximum time for research involvement.

Dual Degree Program in Oral Biology and Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.)
There is an opportunity for students who have an interest in pursuing both a Ph.d. degree in oral biology with The Graduate school to simultaneously pursue a doctor of dental surgery (d.d.s.) degree in the school of dentistry. This special program is a seven-year program that allows the pursuit of both degrees simultaneously, and results in awarding of both the Ph.d. and the d.d.s. degree upon completion of the requirements for both programs.
Applying for this dual degree program is an option when applying for either the oral biology graduate program or for the d.d.s. program
in the school of dentistry. The applicant must indicate an interest in pursuing the dual degree program at the time of application, and will be interviewed and accepted into the program as a dual degree student. The application deadline for this dual degree program is november 1 (the deadline for the d.d.s. program). students applying for the dual degree program must take either the Graduate record examination (Gre) or the dental Aptitude test (dAt), but are not required to take both exams. All other requirements for application to the dual degree program are identical to the application process for the oral biology graduate program. students not chosen to enter the dual degree program would still be eligible for admittance into either the d.d.s. program or the oral biology graduate program through the regular application process.
students accepted into the dual degree program will follow a specialized curriculum, which combines scientific and clinical training with research activities designed to promote a career in academic dentistry. The first two years of the program will consist of basic didactic courses in the Ph.d. program coupled with laboratory experiences, followed by a four- year period of the d.d.s. comprehensive clinical care education and continued dissertation research. The final year(s) consists of completion of the Ph.d. dissertation. students who successfully complete the program will then be awarded both the Ph.d. and d.d.s. degrees at
the completion of the requirements for both degrees. students who are not eligible or who choose not to complete both programsbut rather pursue only the d.d.s. degree must apply to the d.d.s. program and be accepted through the regular application process.
Oral Epidemiology
The University of north Carolina offers a program leading to a Ph.d. degree in epidemiology under the cooperative auspices of the school of dentistry’s department of dental ecology and the school of Public Health’s departments of epidemiology and Health Policy

The graduate program in the department of economics prepares students for teaching and research careers in the fields of econometrics, financial econometrics, health economics, international trade and development, labor economics, microeconomic theory/industrial organization, and monetary and open economy macroeconomics. during the first year of the program, students concentrate on the
core areas of econometrics, macroeconomics, and microeconomics. later, each student chooses two fields of specialization within those mentioned. The department’s objective is to provide students both with broad training in theory and econometrics and with specialization in the major and minor fields.
A number of students supplement their study in economics at UnC– Chapel Hill with work in finance, statistics, mathematics, biostatistics, urban and regional studies, computer science, and operations research, along with courses at duke University and north Carolina state University. strong offerings in these and other related areas enhance the overall graduate training offered to students.
Master of Science
The focus of the graduate program in economics is on the doctorate offerings. Most of the students in the master’s program have already been admitted to a Ph.d. or professional program at UnC–Chapel Hill.
The master’s degree requires eCon 710, 720, and 700, one course
in econometrics (eCon 771 or 870), two courses in a major field, three electives, and a research course (eCon 992). Courses are to be selected in consultation with, and with the approval of, the director of graduate studies and the faculty in the major field. A master of science student writes a research paper under the direction of the faculty advisor. Also, all candidates must pass a written exam in the major field, with the paper advisor responsible for the examination. The Graduate school Handbook describes the general requirements for the master’s examinations and for the papers.
Doctor of Philosophy
Course Requirements. A doctoral candidate must complete 15 Ph.d.-level courses plus two semesters of the doctoral dissertation course (eCon 994). Unless otherwise specified by the faculty in the major field, at least 12 of the 15 courses must be from the economics department. All courses must be approved by the director of graduate studies.
Courses in the Fundamentals of Economics. The following seven courses or their equivalents are required: eCon 710, 711, 720, 721, 700, 770, and one additional econometrics course.
Courses in the Major and Minor Fields within Economics. each student selects a major and a minor field from among the following fields within economics:
• Econometrics
• Financial Econometrics
• Health Economics
• International Trade and Development
• Labor Economics
• Microeconomic Theory/Industrial Organization • Monetary and Open Economy Macroeconomics
At least three courses in the major field and two courses in the minor field are required. one of the courses in the major field is usually a seminar course.
Courses in Supporting Fields. The remaining courses are supporting courses chosen by the student in consultation with the director of graduate studies and other faculty. The supporting courses may be within the major or minor field or in areas that complement the major and minor fields.
Foreign Languages-Research Skill. Additionally, a student must demonstrate competence in one foreign language or fulfill a research skill requirement. Courses satisfying the research skills requirement are usually in econometrics, quantitative methods, mathematics, statistics, or computer science.
Doctoral Exams and Dissertation. students must pass qualifying exams in macroeconomics, microeconomics, and the major field. The faculty in each field determines whether the major field qualifier is a four-hour written exam or a paper. The qualifiers are given in August and January of each academic year; major field papers are due early in the semester. The three-hour macroeconomics and microeconomics qualifying exams are first taken in August of the second year and the major field qualifier in August of the third year. The exams are also given in early January. students have two chances to pass each of the exams and may petition the Appeals Committee for permission to take the macroeconomics or microeconomics qualifier for the third time.
The Graduate School Handbook describes the requirements for the doctoral oral exam, doctoral dissertation, and final oral defense of the dissertation. The doctoral oral exam includes an evaluation of the thesis prospectus.
The general regulations of The Graduate school apply to students receiving graduate degrees in economics from the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Fellowships and Assistantships. The department offers several fellowships and a number of research and teaching assistantships.
All applicants to the Ph.d. program are considered for financial support, and most students enrolled in the Ph.d. program receive a stipend, tuition assistance, and health insurance from the economics department or other sponsors for the first five years of the program. detailed information regarding the fellowships, assistantships, and instructorships may be obtained from the director of graduate studies in economics or at www.unc.edu/depts/econ.
Graduate standing in economics or permission of the director of graduate studies in economics is required for all courses numbered 700 or higher.

The school of education, in keeping with the general goals of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, embraces a threefold mission of teaching, research, and service. with these purposes
in mind, the school’s graduate programs are designed to meet the needs of professional educators who seek to further their knowledge, understanding, and skills relating to educational processes. These professionals vary in their career orientations. some are employed in (or wish to become employed in) educational institutions and others in agencies and organizations performing non-instructional educational functions.
The research mission involves continuing inquiry into the development of knowledge of the teaching-learning process, human development, the organization of schools and educational agencies, the historical, social, and philosophical bases for educational institutions, and the processes of program development and implementation.
The service mission provides public and private institutions and agencies with the benefits of research and consultation, thereby enhancing these institutions and agencies’ ability to satisfy their educational objectives.
The teaching mission involves the faculty and graduate students in applying the knowledge base in field settings and translating it into coursework.
The school of education has attempted to present correct information as of the printing date of this record. However, this information does not establish a contractual relationship and the school reserves the right to alter any statement when review is complete. Therefore, applicants should contact the school of education to obtain updated information on programs prior to final application procedures.
Degree Programs
Note: Additional information may be found on the School of Education’s Web site at soe.unc.edu.
The school of education offers two doctoral degrees: 1) the doctor
of philosophy (Ph.d.) in education with five research areas (applied developmental sciences and special education, cultural studies and literacies, learning sciences and psychological studies, policy, leadership and school improvement and teacher education and curriculum) and in school psychology and 2) the doctor of education (ed.d.) in educational leadership and in curriculum and instruction.
The master’s programs include the following degrees: 1) the master of arts in teaching (M.A.t.) with a concentration in secondary education for english, social studies, foreign language and english as a second language, 3) the master of education (M.ed.) in school counseling and the master’s for experienced teachers, and 4) the master of school
administration (M.s.A.) in educational leadership. The Graduate school administers all but the master of school administration program and
the master’s for experienced teachers, which the school of education administers.
two off-campus, part-time programs are offered: the master of education (M.ed.) for experienced teachers and the flexible master of school administration (M.s.A. flex). The potential specialty areas for the M.ed. program are early childhood intervention and family support (birth through kindergarten); literacy, social studies, mathematics, science, technology and special education.
The part-time, off-campus M.s.A. flex program is designed for working professionals and stretches the normal two-year program offered on campus over an extended period of two and a half academic years, beginning each January with a new cohort. while the program emphasizes preparation for the school principalship, individuals with other educational career aspirations (such as district-level leadership positions) will find it appropriate.

Programs of Study
Master of Arts (M.A.) in Education
The MA in education is currently under administrative review.
Master of Education (M.Ed.) for Experienced Teachers
The M.ed. for experienced teachers is a part-time, field-based program for teachers currently employed in local schools, public and private. The program is designed to assist licensed teachers with at least three years of experience in reflecting upon their experiences and developing further skill and art as professional educators. it is a 31- to 35-hour program (depending on the content area) that begins in the summer, extends through the next two years, and concludes in the third summer. Courses are offered at local sites, not on the University campus, for
the convenience of practicing teachers. Courses during the school year are offered generally from 4–7 p.m. Courses include the use of the blackboard software suite of programs, as some portion of students’ work is done online via computer.
The M.ed. in early Childhood intervention and family support prepares the experienced early childhood professional with leadership skills in developing and implementing inclusive programs for infants/toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergartners with and without developmental delays. it is a 34- to 36-hour program that is typically completed by part-time students in two to two and one-half years; and by full-time students, in one and one-half calendar years. The program is designed to accommodate practicing professionals’ schedules by offering courses in the late afternoon, evenings, and during the summer months.
The school of education offers and administers the M.ed. for experienced teachers program. for program information or an application, please visit the school’s web site at soe.unc.edu or call 966- 1346.
Master of Education (M.Ed.) in School Counseling
The M.ed. program in school Counseling at the University of north Carolina is predicated on the strengths-based school Counseling (sbsC) model that asserts that the school counselor’s primary role is to promote and advocate for positive youth development for all students and for the environments that enhance and sustain that development.
The sbsC approach characterizes positive youth development as nurturing and enhancing empirically identified student strengths or competencies rather than focusing on student weaknesses and problem areas.
sbsC provides a framework to guide the practice of school counseling in the 21st century that is both compatible with and operationalizes many of the features of the AsCA national Model for school Counseling Programs.
strengths-based school counselors employ a variety of direct (e.g., counseling, classroom guidance) and systemic (e.g., consultation, advocacy) level interventions to promote culturally relevant student development in the academic, personal/social, and career domains. The strengths-based perspective identifies the counselor as a school leader who works with students, teachers, administrators, parents, and other members of the community and promotes strengths-enhancing environments for all students.
Requirements
The M.ed. program in school counseling consists of four semesters of full-time study, 60 semester hours of course work, over a 14-month period. students normally begin classes during the last week in May. students finish the program by August of the year following their entrance into the program.
because the 60 semester hours of course work are completed in a 14-month period rather than the more traditional two-year period for programs of this type, this is a very concentrated and intense program. As a result, only full-time students are admitted and students may not enter the program at times other than the one specified above.
1. Thirty (30) hours of content courses.
2. twenty-four (24) hours of skill/clinical courses
3. six (6) hours of graduate level electives, approved by the advisor
The program of study can be found on the school of education web site at soe.unc.edu
4. + fall Practicum runs August through october. fall internship runs october through december. students must spend a minimum
of 100 (40 direct service) clock hours in practicum and 600 (240 direct service) in internship in their field experiences during
the August to June K–12 public school year. The schedule for
edUCAtion 149
￼￼

￼accumulating the required 700 hours is typically completed in three full-time days per week at the school site and/or arranged with both the field supervisor and the edUC 611 and 705 instructors.
Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.)
The Master of Arts in teaching (M.A.t.) program is designed for individuals wishing to teach in secondary school (grades 9–12) or in kindergarten–grade 12 special subjects. secondary school subjects include english, latin, and social studies. special subjects include english as a second language, french, German, Japanese, and spanish. This school- based, student-centered program relies on partnerships between public schools and the University and uses the realities of the classroom as
the motivation for students to connect theory and practice. it provides opportunities for students to accomplish three general objectives:
1. expand their understanding of methodology in their content specialization
2. Gain an understanding of curriculum and instruction primarily at the secondary level (but in K–12 in foreign languages, and esl) and
3. Provide knowledge of the social and psychological foundations of education
This program is designed to prepare candidates for initial and advanced teaching licensure in north Carolina.
several interrelated strands of knowledge run throughout the program:
The teaching and Methods strand focuses upon the structure of disciplines, tools of inquiry, and methodologies concerned with instructional strategies, planning and assessment in varied learning experiences and communities.
The learner and learning strand helps teachers design and implement learning experiences for students based on subject matter knowledge, the nature of the learning process, and the nature of learners.
The Context strand focuses on teacher-student-community relationships in schools and classrooms. students will prepare case studies of each type of relationship; analyze them from cultural, historical, and pedagogical perspectives; and develop strategies to address these issues in practice.
The M.A.t. is a 12-month, full-time program that requires a minimum of 33 hours of course work.
The program of study can be found on the school of education web site at soe.unc.edu. some clinical placements will include multiple settings and levels of instruction.
seminars, methods, contexts, learner and learning courses are ongoing over the entire 12-month period and are both interdisciplinary and subject area oriented.
Master of School Administration (M.S.A.)
The M.s.A. on-campus and M.s.A. fleX programs prepare individuals to lead schools and other educational organizations for the schools
of north Carolina and the nation. These programs include three dimensions: 1) Awareness (i.e., acquiring concepts, information, definitions, and procedures), 2) Understanding (i.e., interpreting knowledge to school environments, integrating concepts with practice, and using knowledge and skills in context), and 3) Capability (i.e., applying knowledge and skills to specific problems of practice). while most of those who complete this program move into administrative positions at the school-site level, some assume roles within state, regional, or national organizations that focus on educational professional development, research, or policymaking. The completion of this program leads to eligibility for licensure from the north Carolina state department of Public instruction and qualifies one for administrative
certification in most states. The M.s.A. programs are administered by the school of education. visit the web site at soe.unc.edu.
Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Curriculum and Instruction
The ed.d. program in curriculum and instruction is designed specifically for people who seek to become curriculum leaders for the 21st century. while the main target population for this program will
be those who will work in central office and policy-level positions at district and state levels, the program will also enroll experienced teachers and other school personnel who have or seek leadership roles within school or other educational settings. Potential professional leadership roles for C&i doctoral program graduates include district or state level directors of curriculum and instruction or a specialty area, specialty area supervisors, or school-based leaders working with mentor teachers. A variety of specialty areas may be selected in which program graduates might play a leadership role are , including such 21st-century demands as technology, cultural and linguistic diversity, special education, universal pre-kindergarten, and international education. Additionally, this program will accommodate individuals—both full- and part- time—who seek positions in Curriculum and instruction within higher education, governmental or policy institutions.
Applicants are admitted on the basis of their academic credentials and potential for outstanding contributions to education.

10. A grade of P or better is required in all edUC courses. one grade of f in an edUC course makes a student academically ineligible to continue in the program.
Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) in Educational Leadership
The educational leadership doctoral program develops senior administrative leaders for K–12 school districts throughout the nation. The program prepares central level leaders to excel in an ever-changing national, state, and local educational environment. A director of student support services option prepares leaders as central office level directors/ assistant superintendents for student support services.
￼
Courses are offered in the evenings during the fall and spring terms, and sometimes on weekends. Most students are enrolled part-time and typically take two courses per semester. Classes are scheduled so that many students take two classes in one evening (e.g., on Thursday night, a class from 4 to 6:50 p.m. and another class from 7 to 9:50 p.m.).
students may transfer up to nine credit hours, subject to program faculty approval. Credits must have been taken at the graduate level, for a grade, and within the past five years.
Educational Specialist, Ed.S.
The educational specialist licensure program in educational leadership is advanced study beyond the master’s degree, which is designed to prepare students for leadership and administration at the district office level of
a K–12 school system. Completion of the program typically leads to either north Carolina level i (entry-level Principal) or north Carolina level ii (Advanced Principal) licensure and includes a superintendent concentration.
The ed.s. licensure program is essentially a subset of the ed.d. degree program. obtaining the ed.s. and north Carolina administrative licensure (AP/As) can lead to salary increases for some administrative professionals in north Carolina.
below is a suggested sequence in which to take courses for the ed.s./ ed.d. program. students have five years to complete program course work and, if continuing with the ed.d., an additional three years to complete and successfully defend their dissertation.
students may transfer up to nine credit hours, subject to program faculty approval. Credits must have been taken at the graduate level, for a grade, and within the past five years.

He or she may take up to three of the following seven M.s.A. courses listed below, which are offered at UnC–Chapel Hill, and/or, with the chair’s permission, transfer up to nine M.s.A./ educational leadership credits from another accredited institution.
Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Education
The schools in north Carolina and in the nation face myriad complex issues and challenges. These challenges range from meeting the educational and social-emotional needs of diverse student populations to designing, implementing, and evaluating educational programs within cultural contexts. The Ph.d. in education prepares leaders in educational research who understand these issues and who can improve educational practice using state-of-the-art knowledge and research skills. The design of the program fosters collaboration among faculty and students from diverse disciplines. such cooperation across levels and areas of interest provides the opportunity to develop relevant research agendas. Graduates of this program are prepared for leadership positions in research and teaching at major universities and institutes in the state and nation.
The Ph.d. in education is a single program with five research emphases: applied developmental sciences and special education, cultural studies and literacies, learning sciences and psychological studies, policy, leadership and school improvement and teacher education and curriculum. These five fields blend areas of inquiry that were formerly discrete.
The mission of Applied Developmental Science, School Psychology, and Special Education (ADSSE) program area is to train doctoral students
in the interdisciplinary, theoretical foundations of developmental science. These foundations will provide young scholars with the tools
to advance knowledge about human development from birth through adolescence, with a particular focus on studying children/students at
risk for learning and behavioral challenges. This mission is accomplished by offering research perspectives in (a) the developmental trajectories of families and children/students from diverse socio-culturally backgrounds in the multiple contexts in which they live, including school, home, neighborhoods, and communities as well as a grounding in (b) evidence- based models of prevention that seek to provide equitable opportunities for learning and successful adjustment for all children by emphasizing education and instruction directed towards individual differences among learners.
we have a strong program dedicated to developing a new generation
of interdisciplinary scholars that have acquired a rigorous research knowledge base with expertise in a quantitative, mixed method, and single case methodology. Graduates will work closely with their advisor and committee members to develop the skills and experiences necessary to work as leaders in a variety of research settings, including institutions of higher education as well as governmental entities at the state or federal level as well as private research firms. Throughout the doctoral experience, students will engage in research activities, grant writing, and the dissemination of their research and prevention efforts, such as presenting their research at local, state, and national conferences, and teaching college level classes.
The Cultural Studies and Literacies strand is designed for future scholars and researchers who will study the linguistic, social and cultural contexts of education and how culture, language and education are produced locally, nationally and globally. This strand prepares future scholars, researchers and faculty who work in the areas of multiple
and critical literacies, social and cultural foundations of education, the intersectionality of race , gender, language, sexual orientation and class, qualitative research methods broadly conceived, and how all to these contribute to creating social and educational inequities. our focus
is both critical and constructive. our efforts first describe, interpret and critique current practice and belief and then move to strategizing about how to create a more equitable society and world. we prepare scholars to be first rate educators, theorists, and qualitative research methodologists-- and advocates for change.

￼The Learning Sciences and Psychological Studies (LSPS) Ph.d. program draws upon the relatively new field of learning sciences that has emerged to address the increasingly inter- and multidisciplinary nature of work within and beyond the academy. Program faculty represent a diverse set of academic backgrounds and fields (e.g., critical theory, educational psychology, psychometrics, school psychology, socio-cultural studies, mathematics and science education, technology studies, statistics).
lsPs focuses on learning, a cognitive, social, and cultural activity
that is distributed among the participating actors as individuals and groups within a specific context. The strand examines formal and informal learning within and across multiple contexts (e.g., teaching
and learning in classrooms, centers, communities, homes, museums, schools, virtual environments) from multiple perspectives (e.g., critical, disciplinary, design-based, post-positivist, post-structuralist, and structuralist). The rigorous study of formal and informal learning utilizes multiple paradigms and employs quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches most appropriate for the questions investigated. The examination of formal and informal learning seeks to understand how people learn and how this learning is influenced by knowledge, networks, social and societal structures, tools (e.g., technology), and an array of socio-cultural factors. The goals of this examination of learning is to produce theory, generate research, inform policy, and develop practice that lead to the construction and design of environments that facilitate optimal opportunity, and access for and development of all participants, within the contexts in which formal and informal learning occurs. lsPs is committed to the preparation of doctoral students
who develop an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary-based expertise within a concentration (e.g., mathematics and science education, education and technology, cognition and learning, quantitative methods and evaluation). lsPs intends to develop doctoral candidates who thoroughly understand theory, research, the paradigmatic underpinnings of each, and the plausible implications of each for policy and practice; who are able to generate scholarship and design and conduct rigorous theory-driven research appropriate for the issues identified; and who are able to foster mutually informative, translational relationships among the diverse stakeholders in academic, policy, and practice communities.
students interested in lsPs can elect to concentrate in a number of areas including Mathematics education, science education, educational technology, Cognition, and Quantitative Methods and evaluation.
The Ph.d. program in education, learning sciences and Psychological studies (lsPs) prepares students to: a) conduct rigorous theory development and research that spans multiple academic disciplines, using multiple and mixed methodologies, to understand how people learn in an array of formal and informal educational settings, b) integrate and critique these multiple perspectives on learning, c) design environments, contexts, and interventions that facilitate learning and development
in these educational settings, and d) foster mutually informative, translational relationships between academic, policy, and practice communities. The design of the lsPs program requires committed engagement on the part of students, and faculty, in order to benefit from the dynamic interaction that occurs when multiple, interdisciplinary perspectives are used to inform learning and achievement.
The faculty of the lsPs program represent diverse of academic backgrounds (e.g., educational psychology, sociocultural studies, steM education, technology studies, educational testing, statistics). The faculty are committed to the preparation of multidisciplinary doctoral students who will be highly competitive for top positions in academia, research organizations, private industry, non-profits, and school and other environments. A key aspect of that preparation is the engagement of doctoral students as key participants in maintaining robust research agendas around the both the science and practice of learning.
The aim of the Phd program in Policy, Leadership and School Improvement (PLS) is to prepare leaders who will influence the direction of educational organizations at home and around the world. The program produces scholars, administrators, and analysts for leadership roles in K-12 systems, universities, research organizations and policy- making bodies. it does so by developing students’ understanding of the societal, political and economic conditions affecting schools; the capacity to analyze educational problems and their proposed solutions; and the ability to design innovations and implementation processes that work.
The Phd program in Pls is among the few programs at elite public universities in the nation to offer opportunities to study with a faculty whose work in K-12 administration, education policy, and school improvement is internationally known. As leaders in these areas, our faculty work collaboratively with students to develop research questions and hypotheses, study them in state and national settings, and link findings to practice. faculty and students in Pls are engaged in the examination and critique of today’s important and contested issues in education, including:
• Teacher quality
• Turn-around schools
• High school effectiveness
• Resource allocation
• Principal instructional leadership
• Issues of class, gender, immigration and race in education
in addition to disciplinary core and research courses, students pursue programs of study that include courses in policymaking, education program evaluation and policy analysis, school law, leadership, educational innovation, implementation, and taking reforms to scale. in combination with courses in quantitative, qualitative and mixed research methods, students develop their research skills through a professional seminar and assistantships with faculty. Committed to professional service, our faculty are also members of editorial boards and advisory forums at the national, state and local levels. They also work directly with school systems, consulting on issues of staffing, instructional delivery, and governance. Pls faculty are currently working with the federal race to the top initiative in north Carolina and a national education research center funded by the U.s. department of education.
The Teacher Education and Curriculum(TEC) strand provides advanced study for students who wish to situate their research and scholarship in these fields which are sites for considerable national debate. There is a growing need for scholarship that incorporates school-based inquiry along with research that considers policy and socio-cultural contexts of teaching and learning so as to inform educational practice. The strand provides a venue for advanced study and research in interdisciplinary curriculum areas and in teacher education. students who select this strand will take additional courses in other doctoral strands in the school of education and in other programs and colleges across UnC’s campus. Graduates will be ready to assume teacher education positions and/or curriculum studies positions.
Teacher Education Core:
• Teacher and Professional Knowledge and Change
• Diversity in Teacher Education OR Comparative Perspectives of teacher education
• Research and Policy in Teacher Education • Intellectual History
• Learning Theories
￼
Curriculum Core:
• Intellectual History
• Learning Theories
• Advanced Curriculum in the Disciplines OR Curriculum Theory
• Institutional Logics of Curriculum and Teaching

students in the Ph.d. program are required to maintain full-time enrollment through the completion of course work, with the expectation that they will graduate in three to four years. Programs of study are available on the school of education web site.
Note: EDUC 710 (Introductory Statistics) or its equivalent must be completed prior to admission to the program or taken during the first year of study. If taken during the first year of study, the hours do not count towards the hours for the Ph. D. A minimum of six hours of dissertation credit is required.
Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in School Psychology
The doctoral program in school psychology, fully accredited by the American Psychological Association and approved by the national Association of school Psychologists, prepares school psychologists as scientist-practitioners to assume leadership positions in academic, research, and applied settings.
Program graduates are eligible for psychological and educational licensing in north Carolina and national certification by the national Association of school Psychologists.
The doctoral program of studies is comprised of seven areas: assessment, intervention, consultation, research and evaluation, professional development, externship/internship, and foundations. students are required to take courses from each of the psychological foundations.
doctoral students in school psychology should enter the program with course work in personality theory, abnormal psychology, learning theories, and developmental psychology. students must enter with at least three prerequisites. A missing prerequisite must be made up the first semester of enrollment.
The program of study for the Ph.d. in school psychology can be found on the school of education web site at soe.unc.edu.
Licensure
The school of education recommends eligible graduates of its approved teacher education programs to the north Carolina state department
of Public instruction for licensure as teachers, administrators, school counselors, school psychologists, and curriculum and instruction specialists. in addition, the school recommends licensure candidates from the following University degree programs: the school of information and library science (for school media coordinators), the school of social work (for school social workers), and graduates of
the speech-language pathology program in the division of speech and Hearing sciences.

The department of english and Comparative literature offers a Ph.d. in comparative literature and in english. each program is described in detail below.
Ph.D. in English
The english program offers work leading to the doctor of philosophy degree, with a major in one of the following areas of specialization:
• The English language
• English literature from its beginnings to 1485
• English literature from 1485 to 1660 (including Milton) • English literature from 1660 to 1789
• English literature from 1789 to 1900
• American literature to 1900
• American literature from 1900 to the present
• British literature from 1900 to the present
• Critical theory and cultural studies
• Rhetoric, composition, and literacy
• African American literature
• Southern literature
• Gender studies
• Queer studies
with faculty approval, students may also develop their own major field.
Ph.d. students also focus on a minor, chosen from one of these
fields just listed, or from a genre (drama, novel, poetry) or the
english language or from the following alternative minors: American studies, Celtic, comparative literature, cultural studies, latina/latino literature, medieval studies, renaissance studies, and women’s studies. Alternatively, students may develop their own minor within the department or take an appropriate minor outside the department, with the approval of the director of graduate studies.
for the doctor of philosophy degree in english, students must fulfill the following course requirements: enGl 606, an introduction
to Graduate study, three seminars in the major, one seminar in the minor, and two courses in allied fields. They will also participate in a third year colloquium. in addition to course work, a candidate for the Ph.d. must pass two examinations administered by the department for which he or she prepares by working closely with a faculty committee a year in advance: a written examination in the major and minor, and an oral examination in the major and minor. doctoral candidates
must also demonstrate a reading knowledge of two foreign languages. The program culminates with the candidate writing a dissertation (and registering for at least three semester hours of enGl 994) and successfully defending it in an oral examination. students must also satisfy residence credit requirements set by The Graduate school. The department strongly recommends that candidates for the Ph.d. have supervised classroom teaching experience before receiving the degree. such experience, when it can be offered, is considered as fulfilling a requirement for the degree. students generally take four years beyond the M.A. to complete the degree.
Ph.D. in Comparative Literature
Comparative literature at UnC is inherently interdisciplinary, global, and transhistorical, and thus it remains one of the most innovative programs in the Academy today. The Program boasts particularly
strong resources in medieval and early modern literature, comparative romanticisms, visual culture and global cinema, and romance language studies. we encourage our graduate students to discover their particular field, learn its histories, and define its problems on the basis of shared critical rigor. we draw together a number of core faculty and many more affiliated faculty from across the university as we strive to balance a belief in the value of a shared critical language with the exigencies of working in particular national languages, locations, literatures, and media.
A minimum of 16 courses is required for admission to doctoral candidacy; this minimum excludes consideration of the dissertation registration required by the Graduate school. All students are
required to complete at least two CMPl courses during their first
three semesters in residence, including both CMPl 700 (literary Theory and the Practice of Comparative literature) and CMPl 841 (literary Theory and Criticism from Antiquity to 1700). in many
cases the faculty advisor may recommend registering for other CMPl courses: for example, students specializing in modern literature are encouraged to take CMPl 842 (literary Theory and Criticism from 1700 to 1900) and/or CMPl 843 (literary Theory and Criticism from 1900 to the Present); students specializing in earlier literature or non- western literature may be advised to take other courses in theory and methodology. our curricular focal points include linguistic competence (of a minimum of three languages), theoretical fluency, and knowledge of the history of criticism.
Through course work, independent reading, and research, and with the support of an academic advisor, students develop a major “field” of study, as well as a minor “focus” of interest that often takes shape within or adjacent to the major field of study. The student’s organization of the field

￼and focus should to be rigorous enough to situate the student within a discipline, tradition, or area, and supple enough to accommodate his or her specific interests, questions, and predilections. subject to the approval of the academic advisor and the director of graduate studies, the field and focus will form the basis of the Ph.d. examination (written exams on each field, and an oral exam, on both, thereafter).
students may choose from, but are not limited to, such fields as: • African and /or African Diaspora literatures
• American literatures — either U.S. or North American and/or Central American and/or south American
• Caribbean literatures (in French, English, Spanish, and other languages)
• Classical literatures
• East Asian literatures
• English / Irish / Scottish / Welsh / “British” literatures
• French and/or Francophone literatures
• Germanic literatures
• Italian literature
• Latin American literatures (Spanish or Spanish / Portuguese)
• Middle Eastern / Arabic / Islamic literatures
• Postcolonial literatures — New World (Canadian/Caribbean), or south Asian, or Pacific rim, etc.
• Russian and/or Slavic literatures • South Asian literatures
• Spanish / Iberian literatures
examples of areas of focus may include, but are not limited to: • Classical (Greek, Roman, Late Antiquity/Early Christian)
• Medieval (or pre-modern Islam / Asian studies)
• Renaissance / Early Modern (usually up to 1700 in Northern Europe)
• Neoclassical / 18th Century / Enlightenment / “Age of Empire”
• Early Transatlantic / Colonial Americas (roughly 1450–1750, or a portion thereof)
• Enlightenment / Romanticism (roughly 1750–1840)
• Nineteenth Century
• Modernism (late 19th and early-to-mid 20th Century) • Contemporary (1945 to the present)
Admissions Requirements
Application for admission must be made by The Graduate school’s electronic application process. These also serve as applications for fellowships and assistantships if the applicant marks the appropriate statement on the form.
Applicants for advanced degrees must have completed an undergraduate degree, customarily with a major in english, comparative literature, a foreign language literature, or related field, at the time of enrollment. to be reviewed for admission by the department’s Graduate Advisory Committee, applications must be supported by Graduate record examination (Gre) scores, at least three letters of recommendation, and official transcripts showing courses, grades, and degrees awarded.
A writing sample and a personal statement should also be submitted. Those students applying to the Ph.d. Program in Comparative literature should also submit (by mail on a Cd or by email as an mp3
or mp4 file) a 5–7 minute long recorded sample of the student reading a selection of text in his or her second language beyond english. This recorded sample should be sent to the attention of the director of Graduate Admissions in Comparative literature.
students who have already completed an M.A. degree in english, comparative literature, or a foreign language literature, or comparative literature at another institution may petition the relevant director of graduate studies for a reduction of up to nine credits (three courses) from their UnC requirements. More information about the department can be obtained via its web site at englishcomplit.unc.edu.
Fellowships and Assistantships
financial support for graduate students is described in the Admissions and financial information chapter. All applicants to the department
of english and Comparative literature are eligible to compete for University fellowships and assistantships. in addition, the department awards two types of assistantships—research assistantships and teaching fellowships. neither is usually available in the summer. research assistants are assigned to faculty members to help with research projects. teaching fellows have full instructional responsibility for sections of beginning composition courses. Graduate students in the third year of the english Ph.d. program who also have taught at least four sections of composition become eligible for teaching literature courses. Graduate students in the Comparative literature Ph.d. program who also have taught at least four sections of foreign languages or composition become eligible for teaching comparative literature courses. non-native speakers are not considered for teaching fellowships until they have been enrolled in the Ph.d. program for at least a year. teaching fellows earn an annual stipend, which can vary depending on whether a fellow teaches two or three courses in a year. teaching fellows are trained and supervised by the directors of composition and undergraduate studies and are subject to student and faculty evaluation.
Foreign Language Proficiency
The Comparative literature program requires new Ph.d. students to arrive with fluency in a second language and at least a beginning level of a third. The program encourages study and research abroad, as well as summer language study to increase foreign language proficiency. Graduating Ph.d. students are expected to achieve a level of expertise in a foreign language that would enable them to teach in a foreign language department, as well as in a comparative literature or english department.
The english program also considers a reading knowledge of foreign languages essential to the educational and professional aims of its degree programs. Ph.d. candidates in the english program must demonstrate proficiency in two languages. The department recommends latin, french, German, italian, or spanish. The use of other languages to fulfill the requirement must be approved by the director of graduate studies. An undergraduate major in an approved language automatically satisfies the requirement. ordinarily, however, students fulfill the requirements by passing an examination administered through the University;
by completing reading courses for graduate students offered by the Classics, German and romance languages departments; or, while enrolled as graduate students, by completing with a grade of at least b an undergraduate literature course in a foreign language. one foreign language requirement must be satisfied before the completion of english Ph.d. exams; the second requirement must be satisfied before the student schedules the Ph.d. defense.
Library and Research Facilities
The library system at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill is ranked among the top 20 research libraries in the United states. it
￼
has excellent holdings for the study of english philology and british
and American literature, including the southern Historical Collection (containing manuscripts, letters, and diaries) and the Hanes Collection of incunabula. Through cooperative arrangements, university libraries in the triangle area are open to graduate students from the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Publications
Early American Literature, Studies in Philology, The Southern Literary Journal, a/b: Auto/Biography Studies and The Keats-Shelley Journal are edited by english department faculty members and have their editorial offices in the eCl department building.
Doctor of Philosophy Degree with a Minor in
Renaissance Studies
students working on their doctorate in one of the regular departmental programs may, with the approval of their departmental director of graduate studies, submit for the degree an interdisciplinary minor in renaissance studies. The program is based in the Comparative literature program and administered by the Arts and sciences Committee for renaissance studies. The minor requires a minimum of five courses. of those five, one must be CMPl 892, seminar in renaissance studies. The remaining four courses must represent equally two fields other than the major field (e.g., a student with a major in italian could offer from the approved list two courses in french, two in latin, and CMPl 892).
CMPl 892, seminar in renaissance studies, serves as a nucleus for the minor, affording students the opportunity to bring together seemingly divergent strains in an interdisciplinary context. normally the faculty member giving the course invites other members of the renaissance faculty to participate in the discussions and to present related materials from their own field of inquiry. student participants choose a related topic or area for research and all report regularly on their own projects under investigation. The course is cross-listed as appropriate, under departmental offerings.
The minor in renaissance studies for the Ph.d. is examined orally at the departmental oral examination (not the defense), unless written examination is required by departmental policy; normally faculty with whom the candidate has taken courses serve as examiners.
A working knowledge of latin is strongly recommended for students in the program.

The Curriculum for the environment and ecology (Cee) is a multidisciplinary, degree-granting program that seeks to foster
an understanding and appreciation of ecological systems and to demonstrate the value of ecological approaches to the solution of current and future environmental problems. with the participation of faculty and students from many disciplines and departments, emphasis is placed on interdisciplinary activities that explicitly consider the complexity of the environment and integrated approaches to problem identification and solution. in particular, it seeks to foster an understanding and appreciation of ecological systems, human and nonhuman, and to demonstrate the value of ecological approaches to the solution of current and future environmental problems.
The Cee places an emphasis on interdisciplinary activities, and derives one of its major strengths from the participation of faculty and students from many disciplines and departments. Current faculty come from the departments of Anthropology, biology, biostatistics, City and regional Planning, Communication studies, environmental sciences and engineering, Geography, Geological sciences, Marine sciences, Public Policy, and sociology. whereas degree programs with a strong ecology component may be arranged in other departments, the curriculum—by combining many approaches and methods and by linking the social and natural sciences—explicitly considers the complexity of the environment and the need for integrated approaches to problem identification and solution.
Using the resources of many departments, the Cee provides both broad and specialized training in ecology, human ecology, and the study of environmental systems. Graduate degrees available in the curriculum are the master of science, the master of arts, and the doctor of philosophy. Applications will be accepted from persons with varied backgrounds and goals with the specific program of study and research tailored to the needs of the individual.
Requirements for Admission
for admission to the Curriculum for the environment and ecology, an undergraduate degree is required in a natural science such as physics, chemistry, biology, bacteriology, botany, zoology, or geology; a social science such as anthropology, sociology, or economics; a mathematical
area such as statistics, mathematics, or systems analysis; an engineering area; or environmental science. The deadline for a completed application in order for students to be considered for fall admission is in January. However, students must submit all curriculum and Graduate school admission materials by december if they wish to be considered for campus fellowships and other forms of graduate appointments. late applications
￼
will cause students to miss out on some opportunities. detailed information is available on both the Cee web site at www.cee.unc.edu and the UnC Graduate school website at gradschool.unc.edu/admissions.
Degree Requirements
every student must gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of the field of ecology as it is treated among various traditional disciplines. This is accomplished in two ways: first, through the eCol 567 and 569 sequence; and second, through the composition of the student’s advisory committee. students are required to do their best to establish residency in their first year and must apply for residency after their first year in order to be considered for tuition remission in subsequent years.
Doctor of Philosophy
each Ph.d. student, in addition to taking eCol 567 and eCol 569, must register for eCol 994 at least once for three hours credit. There are no other course requirements for the Ph.d. except for those designated by the student’s graduate advisory committee.
owing to the diversity of research methods and approaches within the field of ecology, the curriculum has no explicit research skill course requirements for graduate degrees. The student’s graduate advisory committee is responsible for seeing that the student has gained the proficiencies expected of a degree candidate in the student’s selected area of expertise.

Mission
The mission of the department of exercise and sport science (eXss)
is to discover, create, and promote knowledge of human movement
to improve the quality of life of individuals and society. we prepare individuals to function as scientists, educators, and practitioners. our program offers a master of arts degree in exercise and sport science with specialization in one of three areas: athletic training, exercise physiology, and sport administration. we seek to provide all students with focused, in-depth knowledge and skills, and an understanding of the challenges facing the areas of athletic training, exercise physiology, and sport administration as well as a global understanding of exercise and sport.
in pursuit of maximum fulfillment of our mission, we also offer
quality practical experiences to our students. eXss has an association with numerous other campus and local area units such as athletics, emergency medicine, orthopedics, duke Center for living, the lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Get real & Heel, Meadowmont wellness Center, Campus Health services, Carolina Adventures, Campus recreation, the north Carolina High school Athletic Association, and local public parks and recreation departments. supervised assistantships and internships outside the department
help students develop practical skills in the specific fields of study. furthermore, the thesis, a required research experience, is an integral part of every student’s program of study. Additional research experience opportunities are numerous, and it is an expectation of the department that graduate students will become actively involved in conducting research while studying at UnC–Chapel Hill.
Additional information regarding the department of exercise and sport science can be found at www.unc.edu/depts/exercise.
Master of Arts
The exercise and sport science graduate program offers a master
of arts degree in exercise and sport science. There are three areas
of specialization: athletic training, exercise physiology, and sport administration from which each applicant must choose only one when applying. The minimum number of credit hours required for the degree varies, depending on the area of specialization. specific courses required are determined by the faculty in each area of specialization. in addition to course requirements, all students in all three areas must pass a written comprehensive examination, complete a thesis, and successfully defend the thesis in a final oral examination on the thesis.
Specialization Descriptions
Athletic Training
The department of exercise and sport science in cooperation with
the Campus Health service’s division of sports Medicine, and the department of Athletics offers a specialization in athletic training at the graduate level which has existed as a Post-Professional Athletic training education Program since 1975. This is one of only 15 such graduate programs in the United states that is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic training education (CAAte). The primary
mission of the Post-Professional Athletic training education Program is to educate and develop post-professionals to be leaders in the field
of athletic training. The major objectives for students in the program are 1) to demonstrate excellence in evidence-based clinical practice, 2) to be able to evaluate and conduct clinical research, and, 3) to develop and enhance teaching skills in both the clinic and the classroom. we recruit graduate students who are board of Certification certified athletic trainers who have distinguished themselves both academically and as highly competent clinicians. we provide the means for each graduate student to gain advanced knowledge and experience in prevention, evaluation, management, and rehabilitation of sport-related injuries through a combination of didactic lecture in the classroom, supervised practical application of this knowledge in a clinical setting, and a strong research experience oriented toward clinical practice. All students admitted to this program serve as Graduate Assistants teaching in the lifetime fitness Program and working as athletic trainers in the department of Athletics.
Go to exss.unc.edu/graduate-programs/specializations/athletic-training for additional in-depth information.
Exercise Physiology
The mission of the exercise physiology specialization is to prepare individuals for careers in the wellness industry, including hospital
and corporate fitness centers as well as clinical settings, or to pursue research careers in exercise physiology related fields. students seeking
a focus in fitness/wellness are provided the background, knowledge, testing skills, and practical experience to prescribe safe fitness/wellness programs in a variety of settings, as well as the knowledge to act as a liaison between the medical community and the layperson regarding the health implications of exercise. students preparing for further advanced study in a Ph.d. program are provided in-depth understanding of how physiological constructs are applied to exercise and the environment,
as well as an understanding of the research process. Concomitantly, the student develops laboratory techniques and skills. Many graduate students present their thesis research findings at national and regional meetings of the American College of sports Medicine, and at other professional meetings or conferences. A minimum of 30 hours (excluding prerequisites) of graduate coursework is required.
Go to www.unc.edu/depts/exercise/exercise_physiology/index.htm for additional information.
Sport Administration
The mission of the sport administration specialization is “integrating theory and practice to prepare graduate students for leadership positions in intercollegiate athletics.” based upon an innovative two year learning experience, the sport-administration cohort, comprised of a highly select and diverse group of students from across the United states, engages in both formal course work and intense practical experiences designed to prepare them for a college-sport administration career. during their first year, students are provided challenging coursework in administration, economics/finance, legal issues, sport marketing, governance and compliance, research methods/statistical analyses, and sport facility
and event management. in addition, students engage in extensive “hands-on” event-operations experiences with the University of north Carolina (UnC) Athletic department. during the second year, students complete a full-time, one-year internship in a functional area within
the UnC Athletic department and conduct a rigorous quantitative
or qualitative-based research project. Thirty-two hours of graduate coursework are required.

￼Law and Sport Administration Dual Degree Program (J.D./M.A.)
The dual degree program provides an opportunity for students who
are interested in both law and sport administration to earn both
degrees over four years of study. students benefit from a respected law curriculum, combined with a sport administration curriculum with a unique focus on intercollegiate athletics. There is a growing market in college athletics for professionals with both degrees. Graduates of the dual degree program may work in athletic compliance and enforcement at a university, conference office, or national governing body such as
the national Collegiate Athletic Association (nCAA). legal positions
in athletic departments, fundraising and development, and at law firms that represent colleges and conferences are also likely. students must be currently enrolled in their second year at the UnC–Chapel Hill school of law to apply for the law/eXss dual degree program. students will be responsible for paying tuition and fees separately to both the law school & Graduate school. The M.A. in exercise and sport science must be completed prior to or simultaneously with completion of the J.d.
* departmental requirements – All Areas of specialization
in addition to specialization course requirements, two classes in statistics and research methods (eXss 700, 705), a comprehensive written examination on all coursework, and a thesis (eXss 993) are required of all graduate students in the department of exercise and sport science.
Admission
The master’s degree programs in exercise and sport science are open to individuals from differing backgrounds.

The Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular biology is an interdepartmental predoctoral training program leading to a Ph.d. degree in genetics and molecular biology. The goal of this program is to train students to be creative, sophisticated research scientists within the disciplines of genetics and molecular biology. to this end, we emphasize acquisition of a foundation of knowledge, accumulation
of the laboratory skills required for implementing research objectives, and development of the ability to formulate experimental approaches to solving contemporary problems in the biological sciences. during their first year, students enroll in graduate-level courses and participate in laboratory rotations. subsequently, students select a faculty research advisor and establish an advisory committee. research work is done
in the laboratory facilities of the individual faculty member and is supported primarily by faculty research grants.
The curriculum faculty have appointments in 13 departments in
the school of Medicine, the school of dentistry, and the College
of Arts and sciences. The faculty represent diverse research interests that use the tools of genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to address fundamental questions in the areas of cell cycle regulation, chromosome structure, development and disease models, dnA repair and recombination, genome stability, evolutionary genetics, genomics, human genetics, neurobiology, pathogens and immunity, signal transduction, transcription and gene regulation and virology. students are able to choose from a variety of biological systems and questions for their thesis research.
Requirements for Admission for Graduate Work
Applications from students with good academic records and interest
in research careers in genetics and molecular biology are favorably considered. Applicants preferably have majored or minored in one
of the following disciplines: genetics, biology (zoology or botany), microbiology, chemistry, mathematics, physics or biophysics. They usually have taken calculus and organic and physical chemistry, although these are not essential. Applicants are accepted to begin their initial studies in the fall. They must apply to the program through a unified application program known as the biological and biomedical sciences Program (bbsP). students apply for graduate study in the biological or biomedical sciences at UnC–Chapel Hill. students interested in any of the bbsP research areas apply to bbsP and those whose application portfolio places them highest on the admission list are asked to visit Chapel Hill for interviews. students who are ultimately admitted to UnC make no formal commitment to a Ph.d. program. After completing their first year of study students leave bbsP and
join a thesis lab and matriculate into one of 13 participating Ph.d. programs. during their first year bbsP students are part of small,
interest-based groups led by several faculty members. These groups meet frequently and provide a research community for students until they join a degree granting program. The application consists of Graduate record examination (Gre) scores, transcripts of records, three letters of recommendation, and a statement of purpose, all submitted through the web-based application system of The Graduate school. students are encouraged to apply as early as possible, preferably before december 1. (Applicants seeking a master’s degree are not considered for admission.)
Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
in addition to the dissertation requirements of The Graduate school (four full semesters of credit including at least six hours of doctoral dissertation; a written preliminary examination, an oral examination, and a dissertation), students in the Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular biology must meet the following requirements: complete four didactic courses (two of which are required: Gnet 621, Gnet 631 or Gnet 632, and one or two additional courses which can be selected from a wide variety of options, one seminar course in which at least one-third of the final grade is based upon class participation, act as a teaching assistant for one semester; participate in a student seminar series as an attendee until the oral exam requirement is completed and then as a presenter
in the later years; participate in the curriculum’s retreat and attend the weekly seminar series sponsored by the curriculum and the Carolina Center for Genome sciences. students are required to rotate through at least three laboratories before choosing a thesis advisor. it is strongly recommended that students attend national meetings in order to better understand how their research fits with progress in their field.
Financial Aid
stipends for predoctoral students are available from an niH predoctoral training grant and from the University. tuition, student fees, and graduate student health insurance are also covered by the training grant and the University.

The department of Geography offers advanced work leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees. both the M.A. and Ph.d. degrees are offered, but the major emphasis of the program is on the Ph.d., even for those not yet possessing an M.A. incoming students are roughly evenly mixed between those with and without a master’s degree.
The department of Geography has faculty strength in five overlapping areas of concentration. These represent areas of active faculty research and coherent foci—not mutually exclusive territories. indeed, many students and faculty work on projects that span more than one area. so, while intensive training is offered in a number of diverse areas, the program is noted for its integrative and cross-cutting approach. The department’s diverse graduate students are pursuing a wide variety of research at UnC–Chapel Hill.
Departmental research specializations include:
Biophysical Geography and Earth Systems Science. Here the biophysical environment is examined as an integrated system emphasizing the linkages and feedbacks between terrestrial and atmospheric form and function. The focus is on the interactions between the structure and composition of the earth’s surface, its soils and vegetation, and the atmosphere with those processes that actively cycle energy and material through them.
Geographic Information and Analysis. Here geographic information sciences are applied as an integrated set of spatial digital technologies including tools, techniques, concepts, and data sets associated with geographic information systems, remote sensing, data visualization, global positioning systems, spatial analysis, and quantitative methods.
Nature-Society Studies and Human-Environment Interactions.
drawing on analytical and theoretical perspectives from ecology, sociocultural processes and values, political ecology, science studies, and cultural ecology, UnC–Chapel Hill geographers focus on geographies of environmental change, the political-economic and social contexts
of environmental change, human uses of the environment, and the consequences of such uses.
Social Spaces. Here UnC–Chapel Hill geographers examine cultural geographies of people, places, regions, landscape and resources, space, identity, and representation; social geographies of race, space, gender, urban and community dynamics, rural landscapes and regional
change, health, migration, inequality, and social movements; economic geographies of agrarian and industrial change, science, technology and regional change, post-socialism, political economy, and globalization and international development; and political geography, geopolitics, and political ecology.
Globalization and International Development. Here UnC–
Chapel Hill geographers study the consequences of the processes of globalization (and the anti-globalization and global justice movements they have stimulated) that are reshaping the geographies of international and local capital, labor, technology, information, goods and services, and the post-war fordist geographies of economic, social, and political life in the United states and globally.
Graduate students in the department participate in most departmental governance activities and maintain their own organization, the Graduate Association of Geography students (GAGs). UnC–Chapel Hill professional and graduate students also have an active campus-wide organization. Graduate students have access to extensive research and
GeoGrAPHy 185

￼computing facilities within the department and across campus, and many of our students are involved in specialized departmental research groups. students and faculty have strong ties to other departments and research centers at UnC–Chapel Hill, including the Carolina Population Center, the odum institute for research in social science, the institute of latin American studies (UnC–Chapel Hill and
duke University), the sheps Center for Health services research, the Curriculum in ecology, the Center for Urban and regional studies, the Carolina environmental Program and UnC–Chapel Hill’s schools of public health and medicine. There are also opportunities for course work and research associated with nearby duke University and north Carolina state University. Many students also take advantage of the government and private research facilities in research triangle Park.
incoming graduate students are required to complete three core courses (GeoG 702, 703, and 704) presenting the foundations of geographical theory, communication, and research. Thereafter the program of study is flexible and tailored to the needs of the individual student. students select the appropriate course work and dissertation topic in consultation with their advisor and research committee.
A large proportion of graduate students receive financial assistance. sources of aid include teaching assistantships and work on sponsored research projects within the department, University-wide competitive assistantships, nonservice fellowships and merit scholarships, and externally awarded fellowships.
The department occupies the top two floors of newly renovated saunders Hall and has access to extensive computational laboratories needed
to fulfill its research and teaching mission, with specialized facilities dedicated to spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems. A wide range of geographic data sets are readily available. An extensive collection of geographic books and periodicals, including an exceptionally strong collection of foreign periodicals, is held in the nearby davis library, while wilson library houses a large map library.

The department of Germanic and slavic languages and literatures offers a Ph.d. in German studies in conjunction with duke University, as well as an M.A. in slavic languages and literatures. within the slavic M.A. degree, students may concentrate either in comparative slavic and east european literatures and cultures, or in russian literature and culture. each program is described in detail below.
The Carolina-duke graduate program in German studies is a fully merged graduate program that draws on one of the largest German studies faculties in the country, as well as on the considerable library holdings of each institution. students apply to a single program and graduate with a diploma bearing the names of both duke University and the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The program features a combination of disciplinary rigor and interdisciplinary flexibility that recognizes the fundamental interrelation of all the cultural expressions of societies where the German language
is spoken. taking full advantage of the intellectual, educational, and cultural resources of two great universities, the program offers an attractive combination of individual attention in small classes and a close connection to the broader communities of literature, cultural studies, and German studies at duke University and at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The core German studies faculty represent all branches of research in the field, including medieval studies, gender and sexuality studies, literary theory and poetics, european intellectual history, modernism, realism, German-Jewish studies, Holocaust studies, politics and culture in the 20th century, film and media studies, and contemporary society. faculty engage in innovative, interdisciplinary teaching and research projects

￼involving other departments and programs and support close intellectual ties with major German universities.
students take courses full time in their first year of study; in subsequent years they acquire pedagogical training and teaching experience at both a private (duke University) and a public (University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill) university. Multiple program options are available to students, from the study of historical periods and genres (medieval to contemporary) to literary criticism and theory. interdisciplinary work is strongly encouraged.
Admission is competitive and limited to no more than seven students a year. duke University and the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill are committed to offering five years of full funding, including tuition, to students in good academic standing.
note: The previous Ph.d. programs in German studies at duke University and in Germanic languages at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill no longer admit new students.
Admissions Requirements
we seek applicants who demonstrate academic excellence, and we welcome applicants from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. A bachelor’s degree or the equivalent is required, generally in German studies or a related field. All applications are routed through the UnC Graduate school. Please read UnC’s admissions instructions
at gradschool.unc.edu/admissions for detailed information about the application process and requirements. Questions regarding translation issues and foreign degrees and transcripts should be directed to gsll@ unc.edu.
Application Deadline
Applicants are strongly encouraged to complete their applications by december 8 and must meet all posted deadlines at gradschool.unc.edu/ admissions.
Course of Study
1. five core courses: foreign language Pedagogy, Theories, and Practices; Cultural foundations in German studies, to 1800; Cultural foundations in German studies, 1800 to the Present; Middle High German; and German linguistics. incoming students who have satisfactorily completed equivalent graduate courses may be exempted by the director of graduate studies and graduate advising (dGs) from one or more of the required courses.
2. students are required to take two courses outside the German studies program that complement the students’ areas of interest in an interdisciplinary fashion. in their first semester students take all their course work in the program. in subsequent semesters, students may take one course per semester outside the program. All courses taken outside the program must be approved by the directors of graduate study.
3. A total of 16 courses (including those enumerated above), two of which may be credit for work on the dissertation.
4. A Ph.d. preliminary exam, normally by the end of the third year.
5. An oral dissertation defense, normally by the end of the fifth year.
in addition, students are strongly encouraged to attend the program’s monthly “works-in-progress” seminar, at which faculty, advanced graduate students, and guests present their current research.
Qualifying Requirements
1. satisfactory performance in all course work.
2. satisfactory performance in the teaching program.
3. demonstration of superior level on the ACtfl scale for proficiency in German, including all four competencies (reading, writing, speaking, and listening), usually by the time the student enters the program or by the end of the first year of study.
4. demonstration of reading knowledge in a second foreign language relevant to the student’s research, as approved by the dGs.
5. All students will submit an annual plan of study form each year
prior to completion of their preliminary exam. doing so encourages students to reflect in broad terms on their current intellectual interests and possible future trajectories for these interests. students can access this form on the program’s web site (www.german.trinity.duke.edu/ carolina-duke-grad/) under the “Program of study” tab just below the heading “Qualifying requirements.” The document is titled “Annual Plan of study report.”
6. successful completion of the writing proficiency review, normally by the end of the second year of study. normally, students will submit a revised paper originally written for one of their courses.
7. Completion of the preliminary examination with a grade of “pass.” The exam is normally taken in the third year of study.
8. successful completion of a dissertation chapter review, usually by the end of the fourth year of study.
Course Work Checklist of 16 Courses
1. foreign language Pedagogy 2. foundations, to 1800
3. foundations, 1800 to present 4. Middle High German
5. German linguistics
6–7. electives: Course from outside the program 8–14. electives
15–16. dissertation research
Courses outside German studies: students will normally take at least two courses outside of the German studies program. They are encouraged to take more as relevant to their interests and research.
transfer Credit: students coming in with an M.A. in German may,
at the discretion of the directors of graduate studies, receive credit for coursework completed at their previous institution. A maximum of four courses can be remitted, and decisions about credit for prior course work will be made at the end of the students’ first year in the Carolina–duke graduate program.
Teaching
teacher training is a central component of the Carolina–duke graduate program in German studies. both departments provide rigorous training in foreign language teaching, which includes an introduction to the interdisciplinary fields of applied linguistics and second language acquisition.
teaching assistantships are normally available to students in their second through fifth years of study who continue to make satisfactory progress towards the completion of their degree.
￼
it is crucial that teaching assistants (tAs) have highly advanced German language skills. during their first year, students’ language proficiency
in German will be evaluated. only students who achieve a level of “superior” (see ACtfl guidelines) will be asked to teach in the German language program. students who do not possess the required proficiency in German will be expected to obtain this proficiency as soon as possible.
beginning tAs generally teach first-year German and take the foreign language pedagogy course concurrently with their first semester of teaching. in later semesters, graduate students often teach second-year German, and occasionally more advanced undergraduate courses as well (German culture and society, advanced composition, introduction to German literature). in addition, students may serve as discussion leaders in larger lecture courses or serve as research assistants.
Reviews, Examinations, Dissertation
The Annual Plan of Study Report. All students will have to prepare and submit to the dGs an updated plan of study form by January 31 of years 1–3. once the preliminary exam has been taken, this form is no longer required.
The Writing Proficiency Review. for the writing proficiency review— an hour-long oral review that takes place in the second year of study— students submit a scholarly paper, normally written in english and about 30 pages in length, which expands and reworks a paper written for one of their courses. The dGs sets up a committee of three faculty members, including the student’s primary advisor, in consultation with the student.
Ph.D. Committee. for the purpose of the preliminary examination, the Ph.d. committee consists of four faculty members, including
the faculty advisor, selected by the student in consultation with the faculty advisor and the dGs. A fifth faculty member will be added to the committee for the dissertation chapter review and the dissertation defense. typically, faculty from the preliminary exam will also serve on the dissertation review and dissertation defense committees.
The Preliminary Examination. The purpose of the preliminary
exam is to ensure competency in a teaching field and to establish a comprehensive intellectual framework for the dissertation project.
The exam should be designed so that students approach their teaching interests and dissertation research in such a way as to engage a set of broad questions that will speak to scholars both within and outside the field of German studies. The exam centers on two equally weighted lists, one of which generally concerns itself with a broadly defined literary field, such as a recognized period, movement, or genre across several periods. The other list focuses on a more specific topic such as represents the student’s projected area of doctoral research, it being understood that by “area” of doctoral research something broader is envisioned than a list of texts immediately pertinent to the “topic” of the dissertation. in keeping with the prevalent conception of German studies, at least one of the exam lists ought to have a substantive interdisciplinary component; this might include integrating a particular historical span of literary production with an adjacent and related area, such as visual culture, music, religion, cultural anthropology, literary or critical theory, media studies, philosophy, linguistics, or political theory.
The preliminary examination has both a written and an oral component. in consultation with their advisor and the dGs, students may choose either of the following formats for the written portion of the exam.
(1) An in-house, closed book exam. students are given eight hours to respond to three out of a set of six exam questions assembled by the student’s faculty advisor in consultation with committee members. The program will provide a computer for the exam and a quiet room; legible handwritten exams are also acceptable.
(2) A take-home, open-book exam, consisting of two substantial questions, one on each field, given every other day. students are given 24 hours per question and are expected to submit an essay of roughly 15 pages on the assigned topic. students are encouraged to make use of all available technology and of any materials, resources, databases, etc., they would normally consult while doing research.
The oral portion of the exam, with questions from all examiners, lasts about 90 minutes and generally takes place within two weeks of the written exam.
Dissertation Overview. A successful German studies Ph.d. dissertation must constitute a significant contribution to the field of German studies.
following the preliminary exam in their third year of study, students are generally expected to complete their dissertation chapter review during their fourth year of study, and to defend their dissertation by the end of the fifth year.
Dissertation Chapter Review. in consultation with their advisor, students develop a dissertation project. students submit to the dissertation review committee a chapter of 30–45 pages, a two-to-three- page overview of the dissertation, and a comprehensive bibliography. The oral review lasts approximately 1–2 hours.
Dissertation Defense. when the student and the primary advisor are satisfied that a defensible draft is complete, they will offer it to the members of the committee for final approval and set a date for the final examination (also known as the dissertation defense). The defense will usually be held as soon after submission of the final draft as is practical and in keeping with University and Graduate school requirements.
Study and Research Abroad
students are strongly encouraged to study and conduct research abroad as an integral part of their graduate work. both duke University and the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill have strong, long-standing partnerships with German universities.
duke offers student exchanges with the free University of berlin and the University of Potsdam, programs in which graduate students in German studies regularly participate. Additionally, duke University’s department of Germanic languages and literatures has initiated a graduate student exchange with the University of duisburg-essen, which typically takes the American graduate students to essen for four weeks of intensive study in May or June, with a corresponding visit of German students to durham in september. finally, select graduate students will be invited to serve
as mentors, instructors, and/or program assistants in the undergraduate duke study abroad summer program in berlin.
The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill has partnerships with German universities, including exchanges with Göttingen, tübingen, and the state of baden-württemberg. its German department has a tA exchange with the University of tübingen, annually sending one graduate student to tübingen to teach english and pursue further graduate studies.
further, graduate students in German at duke University and the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill have a strong track record for successful dAAd and fulbright fellowships for study abroad.
The M.A. in slavic languages and literatures meets general requirements of The Graduate school plus certain departmental requirements. A student may emphasize russian literature and culture or comparative slavic and east european literatures and cultures.
All students are required to register for three credits of slAv 993 (master’s thesis credits), write and defend a master’s thesis, and pass an M.A. oral exam to demonstrate mastery of a reading list in the student’s

￼major language concentration(s). This M.A. oral exam generally takes place during the thesis defense. in addition, students must satisfy a language requirement (reading knowledge only) in one modern foreign language other than a slavic language.
The master’s candidate in russian literature and culture requires a total of 31 credit hours (including 3 credits for slAv 993). each student is required to
a) take a 1-credit slavic seminar (slAv 700).
b) take one course (3 credits) in 18th-century russian literature and culture.
c) take seven courses (total of 21 credits) to be distributed, with graduate advisor supervision, in 19th- and 20th-century russian literature and culture.
d) Pass or place out of fourth-year russian Conversation and reading (rUss 412) (3 credits).
The master’s candidate in comparative slavic and east european literatures and cultures is required to
a) take a 1-credit slavic seminar (slAv 700).
b) take four courses (12 credits) in russian literature and culture.
c) take three comparative russian and slavic/east european literature and culture courses, or three exclusively non-russian slavic/east european literature and culture courses (9 credits), in consultation with the graduate advisor.
d) Pass or place out of two courses (one year) in a modern slavic/east european language other than russian.
in addition, students who wish to teach in the russian program are expected to complete the 1-credit russian Pedagogy course (rUss 790) in the year preceding their first year of teaching.

The program promotes close mentoring relationships with faculty and sustains a lively intellectual community among the graduate students.
extensive information about the graduate program in history is available at https://history.unc.edu/graduate-program. Please use this to supplement the brief summary below.
Admission
The department considers applications from those holding undergraduate degrees and those who have obtained M.A. degrees elsewhere. students admitted to the department with an M.A. from
￼
History 207
￼another university will be reviewed by the faculty at the time of entry into the program to determine whether they should take second M.A. degrees here or proceed directly to the Ph.d. training. Preference in admission is given to students who intend to proceed to doctoral work, either directly or after completion of the M.A. degree.
The M.A. Program
The courses required for the M.A. degree usually include an introduction to research (Hist 700) and an introductory seminar (Hist 900), to be taken in the first year of study, a two-semester reading colloquium or its equivalent in the student’s major field, one additional seminar (900-level course), three hours of thesis credit (Hist 993), and four other courses, of which as many as three may be taken in fields other than that in which the student is concentrating or even in other disciplines. M.A. candidates must also pass a reading-knowledge examination in an appropriate foreign language, prepare a thesis
especially notable are the southern Historical Collection (one of the most important manuscript collections on the subject), and the north Carolina Collection (a repository of books, magazines, pamphlets, and newspapers published in or about north Carolina). The southern oral History Program and the Center for the study of the American south further enhance research and training in the history of our region.
The University Center for international studies, the Center for european studies, and the triangle institute for security studies (tiss) sponsor fellowships, seminars, speakers, and other opportunities in their respective areas. The History department participates in the new, interdisciplinary Medieval and early Modern studies Program (MeMs) which offers fellowships and research grants. MeMs places special emphasis upon viewing the premodern world from a global perspective. The Ancient world Mapping Center forms part of the department of History, and there is no other unit worldwide that matches its mission of promoting cartography and geographic information science within ancient studies. for research and other initiatives at the center, visit www.unc.edu/awmc. The department also sponsors the Project for Historical education, an outreach program for teachers in secondary schools. in addition, a wide variety of workshops regularly bring together faculty and graduate students who share interest in particular historical topics or approaches.

Program Description: Doctor of Philosophy
The department of Allied Health sciences in the school of Medicine offers an interdisciplinary program of study in human movement science leading to the doctor of philosophy degree. The intent of this program is to develop research and teaching scholars who are capable of producing and disseminating new knowledge in the field of human movement science.
The doctoral program in human movement science is offered with the cooperative effort of the following departments/divisions at UnC– Chapel Hill: Physical Therapy, exercise and sport science, biomedical engineering, orthopedics, Physical Medicine and rehabilitation, and the Program on Aging. This program is designed to provide students an opportunity for doctoral study in areas that will increase our knowledge of human movement performance. The program focuses on contributing to the scientific basis of human movement, developing theory and methods for maintaining health, preventing disability,
and improving movement ability. focusing on normal movement
and movement disability requires a special emphasis in research and education that draws upon yet differs from the focus of related sciences. students of varied academic disciplines are accepted into the program. students choose one of three tracks as a focus for their course work and research experiences:
• Biomechanics of human movement, including musculoskeletal mechanics and external mechanical constraints
• Exercise physiology of human movement, including exercise response and training in special populations
• Behavioral learning of human movement including neuromuscular control and motor learning.
(The division of Physical Therapy retired the M.s. in human movement science degree, so applicants are no longer being accepted for the M.s. as a terminal degree. bachelor’s level applicants will be considered, given appropriate background and experience in movement science research.)

The programs of the school of information and library science (sils) are designed to prepare students for professional employment and advanced study in the fields of information and library science. The school offers graduate instruction leading to the degrees of master
of science in information science (M.s.i.s.) and master of science in library science (M.s.l.s.), Post-master’s certificate (PMC), and doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.) in information and library science. The school also offers an undergraduate minor in information systems and an undergraduate major in information science (b.s.i.s.).
The M.s.i.s. is designed to prepare students to contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of information systems; to provide leadership in the development of new technologies and new applications relating to the delivery of information to users; and to demonstrate a theoretical knowledge of information science, including the theory of information storage and retrieval, systems science, and social, political, and ethical implications of information systems. within this degree program, students complete a core set of courses and build their own specialized program of studies on this foundation. Areas where students find jobs include (among others) database design and administration, social media, interface design and usability testing, systems analysis and design, archives and digital repositories, systems administration, user training and support, information resources/knowledge management, information systems security, competitive intelligence, and web site design and management.
The goal of the M.s.l.s. program is to prepare students to contribute
to the design, development, and management of libraries and their collections and services; to provide leadership in the development of new services and technologies to improve access to information for users;
and to demonstrate a theoretical knowledge of library science, including the theory of information organization, effective communication, and social, political, cultural, and ethical issues surrounding libraries. Areas where students find jobs include library administration, administration of archives and manuscript collections, records management, documents librarianship, cataloging, public and reference services, acquisitions
and collection management, children’s librarianship, access to and manipulation of database information, special collections, academic subject specialties, and systems librarianship. Graduates of the program are ready to practice within various settings: academic, public, or special libraries, information centers or school library media centers.
The 48 credit hours of course work is selected, in consultation with
the student’s faculty advisor, from the information and library science curriculum, or as appropriate, from related subject fields in other schools and departments of the University or at neighboring universities. A master’s paper or project (inls 992) is also required of each master’s student. A theme within the curriculum for both master’s degrees is evidence-based practice, which requires students to interpret and apply the research of others to their professional situations, as well as to be able to design and conduct their own research where necessary data is not otherwise available.
Graduate certificates within either the M.s.l.s. or the M.s.i.s. are available in the following areas: aging, bioinformatics, clinical
information science, digital curation, interdisciplinary health communication, nonprofit leadership, and international development. A program leading to a certificate as a school library media coordinate is also available as part of the M.s.l.s.
The school of information and library science participates in several dual or cooperative degree programs. These include dual degree programs with:
• the Kenan–Flagler Business School, which combines the master of business administration (M.b.A.) degree and the M.s.i.s. degree.
• the Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, which combines the master of health administration (M.H.A.) degree with either the M.s.l.s. or M.s.i.s. degree.
• the School of Nursing, which combines the master of science in nursing (M.s.n.) with either the M.s.i.s. or M.s.l.s. degree.
• the Department of Art, which combines the master of arts in art history (M.A.) with either the M.s.i.s. or M.s.l.s. degree.
• the School of Government, which combines the master of public administration (M.P.A.) with either the M.s.i.s. or M.s.l.s. degree.
• the School of Law, which combines the juris doctor (J.D.) degree with either the M.s.l.s. or the M.s.i.s degree.
A cooperative archival program allows students to combine the master of arts (M.A.) in public history at north Carolina state University with either the M.s.l.s. or the M.s.i.s. with specializations in archival science. A similar dual degree cooperative program with duke University’s school of Medicine allows students to combine a degree in medicine with either the M.s.i.s. or M.s.l.s. degree..
Participation in any dual degree program requires separate admission to both degree programs.
The basic requirement for admission to the master’s programs is a bachelor’s degree from a recognized college or university. The student’s undergraduate work should demonstrate a strong foundation in liberal arts and sciences. each master’s student is required to enter
the program with a foundation in various technological tools (e.g., HtMl, databases) employed in the field. Admission involves meeting the requirements for The Graduate school, which include submission of acceptable scores on the General test of the Graduate record examination (Gre). for details about the entrance requirements and the curriculum for the master’s programs, see the program descriptions of the school of information and library science, whichare available on the web at sils.unc.edu/programs.
The post-master’s certificate (PMC) in information and library science
is a 30-semester-hour post-master’s degree program that is designed
for practitioners who seek an articulated and systematic continuing education program to enhance their professional career development in information and library science. The school currently offers a specialized PMC in data Curation. students may also design a specialization to meet their individual needs.
The doctor of philosophy in information and library science (Ph.d.)
is a research degree. Thus, the purpose of the doctoral program in
sils is to educate scholars who are capable of addressing problems of scholarly consequence in the field of information and library science. toward this end each student develops a program of studies, which is tailored to individual interests and career goals. required classes include a year-long seminar on research issues and questions (inls 881/882) and completion of an appropriate sequence of courses in statistics. Additional courses in research methods and theory development are recommended, as are research experience and substantive content
￼
courses, which are related to a student’s research interests. There are also opportunities for students to develop teaching skills through both course work and teaching experience.
The school is located in Manning Hall, with the administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, ibiblio.org (one of the most popular web sites on the internet), and the information and technology resource Center (itrC) all contained in that building. The itrC includes
the information and library science library, which holds more than 100,000 volumes, and computer labs. wireless network access is available in Manning Hall and many other locations on campus; direct connections to the campus network are also available in the itrC.
Those interested in any of the sils degree programs should see the sils web site (sils.unc.edu) or request information from the school of information and library science, Cb #3360, 100 Manning Hall, The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, nC 27599- 3360.

The school of Journalism and Mass Communication offers programs leading to the master of arts in mass communication and the doctor of philosophy in mass communication.
Admission
Applications are available via the web through gradschool.unc.edu. Completed forms are submitted to The Graduate school, whose admissions decisions are based largely on recommendations from the school of Journalism and Mass Communication. The minimum criteria for admission to a graduate program in journalism and mass communication are:
• A recognized undergraduate degree (or equivalent credential from a foreign university)
• A recognized master’s degree or J.D., in addition, if applying for the Ph.d. program
• An undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 (A = 4.0)
• The admissions committee has a preference for minimum scores on the Graduate record examination (Gre) of at least the 55th percentile on the verbal section, 50th percentile on the quantitative section, and 4.5 on the analytical writing section
• Three letters of recommendation
• A statement of career intent, indicating how the applicant intends to use graduate education in journalism and mass communication
• A current résumé
• A writing sample. For master’s applicants, this could be an academic paper or magazine or newspaper article; for doctoral applicants, a chapter from their master’s thesis or a copy of an academic paper.
• Ph.D. applicants must also include a separate statement that details a problem that they would like to solve during their time as a doctoral student. Applicants are not committed to researching this problem
if accepted into the program, but the school of Journalism wants to know their research interests.
in addition, international applicants must submit test of english as a foreign language (toefl) scores and the financial certificate as required by The Graduate school.
international applicants must also complete the international student data form and financial Certification instructions/worksheet (available in admission application) and must show proof of financial ability to pay for two years for the master’s program and three years for the Ph.d. program.

Financial Assistance
roy H. Park fellowships are available to seven to eight new doctoral students and 10 to 11 incoming master’s students each year. These fellowships provide handsome stipends, payment of tuition and fees, and health insurance for the student. The stipend for doctoral students each year is $20,500, and master’s students receive a $14,000 annual stipend. doctoral student funding is for three years, and master’s student funding lasts for two years. Continuation of funding beyond the first year is dependent on satisfactory progress in the program. in return for this funding, doctoral and master’s students must work as graduate assistants. These are 15-hour work weeks, and assignments vary according to the needs of the faculty and interest and skill levels of the students. The roy H. Park fellowships are available only to United states citizens. There is no special application for these fellowships. All U.s. citizens qualified for admission to the program are considered
for roy H. Park fellowships. fellowship finalists will be invited to participate in on-campus interviews in february or March.
other financial assistance available for graduate students includes the richard Cole eminent Professor Graduate fellowship, which provides the same level of funding with the same work requirement as the roy H. Park Ph.d. fellowships; the Peter dewitt Pruden Jr. and Phyllis Harrill stancill Pruden fellowship, which provides the same level of funding with the same work requirement as the roy H. Park fellowships; and the Graduate dean’s research Assistantship (work requirement of 15 hours per week), awarded each year to an incoming master’s student with an interest in print journalism or public relations. The school also offers the william f. Clingman Award ($4,000–$8,000) for the study of ethics to continuing students and the $1,000 tom wicker scholarship to continuing master’s students interested in reporting careers. in addition, limited funds for dissertation or thesis research are available through the Minnie s. and eli A. rubinstein Awards. The Margaret blanchard dissertation support fund is available to help current doctoral students finance their dissertation research. The Jim d’Aleo award is given to a current graduate student who has gone above and beyond our already high expectations to contribute something special to the school, the university, the community, or the discipline.
The Master’s Program
The master’s program has three major tracks. The professional track is designed to educate students for professional careers in public relations, advertising, journalism, and other mass communication fields. The
mass communication track gives students the background needed for teaching or research. The interdisciplinary Health Communication (iHC) master’s track offers a broadened program to include the study
of how to effectively communicate with diverse audiences about health issues. students will learn about the possibilities of traditional as well as electronic forms of media and the psychology of persuasion. in all tracks, students are taught to critically examine the role of mass communication in society and are provided with a firm grounding in theory and
analysis. by setting high standards for both scholarly and professional achievement, the school seeks to prepare graduates to be leaders and critical thinkers, no matter what career paths they might take.
The M.A. is designed to meet the needs of 1) holders of the bachelor’s degree in fields other than journalism-mass communication who wish to enter the field, 2) journalists who want more education in a specialized field, 3) experienced journalists or communicators who wish to prepare themselves for teaching, 4) individuals primarily interested in education
￼
for media research, and 5) journalism-mass communication graduates who wish to continue their education and career development.
in other words, this is not strictly a professional master’s program that aims to teach technical skills in writing, editing, photography, and graphic design. nor is the focus solely academic and theoretical. rather, the school seeks to achieve a balance.
Areas of Specialization
early in the program, each master’s student, with his or her advisor, chooses an area of specialization and selects courses that lead to a coherent goal. The area of specialization is usually determined by a career interest and includes courses numbered 400 and above both inside and outside the school. students in the professional track take
at least one 800-level seminar, and those in the mass communication track take two seminars. All of the courses are evaluated for consistency with the thesis, series of articles, or project that the student does as the capstone for the M.A. work. All students must take a research methods course appropriate to the capstone thesis or nontraditional thesis option.
some examples of specializations in the professional track (please
visit jomc.unc.edu/graduate-studies-content-items/ma-in-mass- communication-program-info for a complete listing and descriptions of specializations):
• Strategic Communication: students preparing for careers leading to management and research positions in advertising may choose courses in advertising management and planning, research, new technologies, sales, or some other area. Courses from business, psychology, sociology, and information and library science are suggested as outside courses. students prepare for careers leading to management positions in corporations, nonprofit organizations, government or public relations agencies. Their paths include skills and theory courses in public relations as well as outside areas of interest, including business, organizational and speech communication, and health communication.
• Reporting: for careers in writing and editing for the print media, students choose courses that teach the relevant skills. students also learn the theory and analytical skills needed to eventually hold leadership positions in their chosen fields.
• Other fields for which professional specializations can be designed include business and media, visual communication/editing/ multimedia, electronic communication, and medical and science journalism.
• Paths in the mass communication track can be just as diverse. Students learn the theory and research methods that they need to teach at a small college or to pursue a doctorate in mass communication. They can study mass communication law or history, media effects, new communication technologies, or international communication, among other subjects. depending on the course of study they select, they may also be prepared for a variety of research positions in the public and private sectors. students in this track do not take professional skills courses such as news writing and editing.
students interested in mass communication law may want to consider the M.A./J.d. dual degree program. The program is intended for students with a variety of goals including those who plan to practice mass communication law, pursue academic careers in law and mass communication fields, pursue a Ph.d. degree in a related field or perhaps plan to practice professionally in a communication-related field such
as journalism or strategic communication with a law-related emphasis. information about the M.A./J.d. dual degree program can be obtained by visiting medialaw.unc.edu/for-students/dual-degree-program.
Requirements
Master’s students must earn at least 36 graduate-level credits for the professional track and the iHC track and 39 graduate-level credits for the mass communication track, including three credits for a thesis or nontraditional thesis option. Course requirements for the professional track are divided into five categories: required school of Journalism
and Mass Communication courses (12 credits); school of Journalism and Mass Communication specialization (nine credits); advanced school of Journalism and Mass Communication courses (six credits): courses outside the school of Journalism and Mass Communication
(six credits); and thesis (three credits). Course requirements for the
mass communication track are divided into four categories: foundation courses (nine credits); required school of Journalism and Mass Communication courses (nine credits); Path (18 credits which are school of Journalism and Mass Communication courses and outside courses); and thesis (three credits). This includes a research methods course, generally JoMC 703 or 704, appropriate to the thesis or nontraditional thesis option. two to four of the graduate-level courses should be taken from other University departments. students may select from courses offered by other departments or schools at UnC–Chapel Hill, duke University, and north Carolina state University.
All residential master’s students must pass the school’s usage and grammar test. This exam is a basic requirement for graduation for our undergraduate students and normally poses no major problems for graduate students. information on the spelling and grammar test, including instructions on how to study for it, is included in the orientation packet sent to new students each summer.
required Courses: All master’s students must take Mass Communication research Methods (JoMC 701) and Mass Communication law (JoMC 740). Master’s students in the mass communication sequence must also take Theories of Mass Communication (JoMC 705). in addition, all professional track master’s students must take JoMC
753 reporting and writing news (except for strategic communication students who take JoMC 732, Public relations writing) and JoMC 782, Multimedia storytelling.
if a student receives an l in any required course, he or she must pass a comprehensive examination given during the second semester. if the student fails the exam, he or she must retake the course the following fall. if the student again makes an l, he or she will not be allowed to continue in the program.
Areas of specialization courses: The master’s program is designed to allow students, under the direction of their advisors, to design a course of study, or an area of specialization, that addresses their research and skills interests. regardless of the area of specialization or path, each student must define a coherent theme connecting courses in the school of Journalism and Mass Communication and those outside the school. Those courses must be appropriate to the thesis or nontraditional thesis option. students planning to write a series of articles as their thesis option must take specialized reporting (JoMC 754).
All students must pass the appropriate examinations, which include
a comprehensive written examination covering the material in the student’s path courses (given at the completion of course work), and an oral examination on the thesis or professional project, given by the student’s thesis committee.
M.A. students must complete the degree within five years of admission to the program. students who do not finish within five years may petition for an extension.

￼Thesis, Articles, or Project
in the mass communication track, students must do a traditional research thesis. in the professional track, students have the option of writing a thesis or presenting a professional-quality series of articles (JoMC 993) or project (JoMC 992). The series of articles or project requires the same effort and professionalism as the traditional thesis. in addition to the professional product itself, the nontraditional thesis option requires an extensive review of the literature and statement of methods.
students enroll in Master’s Thesis, JoMC 993, or non-traditional Thesis option, JoMC 992, for three credits as they do the thesis, articles or project. A maximum of three thesis credits can be counted toward the 30 credits required for the M.A.
Length of Program
Most students complete the master’s program in two years, typically attending classes full-time during three consecutive semesters and completing the thesis, articles, or project in the fourth semester. some students find it necessary to stay the summer after their second year to complete their theses, articles, or special projects. Although it is possible to complete the degree by taking classes part time, the school does not recommend it and generally admits no more than one part-time M.A. student per year.
Graduate Committee
to gain the most from the program, students should select a three- member advisory committee early. led by a member of the school’s graduate faculty who serves as the student’s advisor, the committee acts as a resource as well as referee of the thesis, articles, or special project. one member of the committee should be a faculty member from outside the school with whom the student has taken a course.

non-traditional Thesis (final Project)
student work in the M.A.t.C. culminates with enrollment in JoMC 992: non-traditional Thesis, a four-part final project that includes:
• a written proposal for the final project.
• a written document that summarizes the final project.
• a formal presentation and oral examination in which the student presents the completed work to his or her committee.
The final project involves a study around an issue or challenge facing an organization or business with a digital media focus. it emphasizes both scholarly and practical application in line with the professional orientation of the M.A.t.C. The subject of the project may be the student’s employer or may be selected based on the scope of the study.
students complete the final project under the direction of a full-time school of Journalism and Mass Communication faculty member, who serves as chairperson of the student’s final project committee. two additional faculty members and/or an industry professional join the chairperson on the committee.
students enroll in nontraditional Thesis option, JoMC 992, following completion of their course work. A maximum of three thesis credits can be counted toward the 30 credits required for the M.A.t.C.
Length of Program
The M.A.t.C. is designed to be completed in two and a half years
on a part-time schedule. There is a set curriculum, meaning there is a prescribed list of courses that are taken in order. during the first year, students enroll in two courses in the fall, two courses in the spring, and one course in the summer. in the second year, students enroll in two courses in the fall and two courses in the spring. in the third year, students enroll in non-traditional Thesis in the fall.
On-Campus Sessions
M.A.t.C. students must attend two on-campus sessions—a two-day orientation and a weeklong summer residency. These sessions provide essential supplementary training and opportunities to build relationships among students and faculty.
The sessions are held in Carroll Hall, the home of the UnC school
of Journalism and Mass Communication, on the UnC–Chapel Hill campus. Completion of the residencies is a pre-requisite for subsequent M.A.t.C. course registration and is a required portion of the program.
transportation, lodging and meal expenses to attend the on-campus sessions are the responsibility of the student and are in addition to tuition and fees.
Graduate Committee
to gain the most from the program, students should select a three- member advisory committee early. led by a member of the school’s graduate faculty who serves as the student’s advisor, the committee acts as a resource as well as referee of the final project.
Financial Assistance
federal financial aid is available for M.A.t.C. students who are enrolled a minimum of 4.5 hours per semester and who show financial need. The aid is typically limited to federal loans. no scholarships, grants, assistantships or fellowships are currently available through the UnC school of Journalism and Mass Communication.
Ph.D. Program
The Ph.d. in mass communication is designed to prepare students
for college teaching and research positions or research careers in mass communication industries, advertising agencies, market or opinion research firms, business, or government. The school works closely with each student to develop a program of study that is both interdisciplinary, allowing the student to take full advantage of the University’s rich academic offerings, and tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of the student. The goal of the program is to produce outstanding scholars who are highly knowledgeable about mass communication and highly skilled as researchers.
The program is small and very selective; 10 to 12 students are admitted each year. Admissions decisions are based not only on the standard criteria described elsewhere in this catalog—Gre scores, grade averages, and letters of recommendation—but also on a determination of whether the applicant’s interests and goals fit with those of the program and faculty. for that reason, the statement of purpose and statement of research interests that must accompany an application are extremely important, and applicants are encouraged to be as specific as possible in outlining their research interests and career goals.
Requirements
Ph.d. students are required to develop 1) a broad understanding and knowledge of mass communication in modern society, 2) expertise in two areas of specialization in mass communication and 3) competence in an appropriate research methodology. students have considerable flexibility in designing their programs around a core of four courses, which should be taken during the first year of study. The four core courses are Mass Communication research Methods (JoMC 701), readings in Mass Communication History (JoMC 742), Theories
of Mass Communication (JoMC 705), and Mass Communication law (JoMC 740). if a student receives an l in any core course, he or she must pass a comprehensive examination given during the second semester. if the student fails the exam, he or she must retake the course the following fall. if the student again makes an l, he or she will not be allowed to continue in the program.

Length of Program
students normally spend two years taking courses, then take comprehensive exams very early in their third fall semester. They then write their dissertation proposals. After the proposal is approved by the student’s doctoral committee, the dissertation must be completed and defended. The nature of the dissertation research will govern the length of time a student spends on the project, but many students find it takes about one year to complete a dissertation. in general, it takes three years, and often more, to complete the Ph.d. The Graduate school requires students to complete the degree within eight years of entry into the program. students who do not finish within eight years may petition for an extension.
Doctoral Committee
each Ph.d. student selects a five-member dissertation committee, which is approved by the associate dean for graduate studies. This committee consists of three school of Journalism and Mass Communication faculty members and two graduate faculty members from outside the school. The student’s advisor serves as chair of the committee. The committee should consist of professors with whom the student has taken courses. The committee guides the student’s academic development, administers and evaluates the comprehensive exams, and approves the dissertation proposal and dissertation.

The department of linguistics offers graduate work leading to the degree of master of arts in linguistics.
degree candidates must demonstrate both a basic knowledge of the field of linguistics as a whole and the ability to do independent study in a chosen specialty. basic knowledge of linguistics is acquired by taking certain required courses; knowledge of a specialty is gained through elective courses as well as by writing a thesis.
The elective courses are expected to form a coherent program in a subfield of linguistics (e.g., phonology, syntax, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, language acquisition) or in the application of linguistics to a closely related discipline (e.g., anthropology, the study of a particular language or language family). to this end, each student, after
￼￼
linGUistiCs 231
￼consultation with the director of graduate studies, will by the end of the second semester of residence choose a permanent advisor, who will supervise the student’s program of study.
degree programs must satisfy the general requirements of The Graduate school. in addition, the student must fulfill the following curriculum requirements.
Master of Arts
Course Requirements. linG 400 (introduction to General linguistics) or approved equivalent, 520 (linguistic Phonetics), 523 (Phonological Theory i), 530 (syntactic Theory i), one course from among 525 (Historical linguistics), 528 (language Acquisition) and 537 (semantic Theory i), plus four elective courses in linguistics or related areas, as approved by the student’s academic advisor, plus three hours of thesis credit, for a total of 30 hours.
Note: Students are expected to complete their nonelective courses during their first year. This schedule qualifies students to be considered for a linguistics teaching assistantship by their third semester. Deviations from it are therefore strongly discouraged.
the right to question students on other relevant topics. students should avoid scheduling a thesis defense during the summer, since faculty members often are not available. if it is absolutely unavoidable, students should consult committee members well in advance.
Important Degree Deadlines. each year The Graduate school sets deadlines for graduation in a given term (fall, spring, summer). There are two sets of dates to watch out for:
1. students wishing to graduate must submit an application to graduate (handbook.unc.edu/graduation.html). These documents must be submitted in advance: typically July for August graduation, february for May graduation, and october for december graduation, but official dates will be posted on the registrar’s calendar (registrar. unc.edu/AcademicCalendar/index.htm). There is no penalty for failure to complete requirements for a requested graduation date,
but one cannot graduate without having submitted the application to graduate. Therefore students should submit it in time for any semester in which they feel they may graduate.
2. The final electronic version of the thesis must be submitted to The Graduate school before the student can graduate (gradschool.unc. edu/etdguide/submission.html). The deadline for submission is shortly before graduation; please see the registrar’s calendar for current dates ( registrar.unc.edu/AcademicCalendar/index.htm).
note: The previous Ph.d. program in linguistics (1967–2011) no longer admits new students. legacy students should consult the linguistics department web site (www.unc.edu/linguistics/gradprogram.html) for degree requirements.
Courses for Graduate and Advanced Undergraduate Students

the practical skills required to carry out basic experiments in speech production or perception. includes training in a general-purpose programming language (such as Perl) for automating repetitive tasks, experiment-control software, audio stimulus manufacture and editing, palatography, aerodynamic measurements, and other laboratory techniques relevant to student interests.
444 Origin and Evolution of Human Language (3). Prerequisite, linG 101. recommended preparation, at least one higher-level core course in linguistics. surveys current answers to such questions as, When and how did language first appear? What do other animal communication systems share with language? Do restricted linguistic systems (e.g., pidgins) preserve “fossils” of early human language?
445 Philosophy of Language (PHIL 445) (3). see PHil 445 for description.
455 Symbolic Logic (PHIL 455) (3). see PHil 455 for description. 484 Discourse and Dialogue in Ethnographic Research (ANTH 484,
FOLK 484) (3). see AntH 484 for description.
490 Advanced Topics in Linguistics (3). directed readings on linguistic topics not covered in specific courses.
￼Foreign Language Requirement. reading knowledge of one foreign language. This requirement may be met in one of three ways:
1. by passing the Graduate student foreign language test, given each november and April by The Graduate school. for information and registration, go directly to gradschool.unc.edu/student/gflpa.html.
2. where available, by passing the reading courses for graduate students numbered 601 and 602 (these courses do not earn graduate credit). note: students with some prior experience may find it feasible to meet the requirement by enrolling directly in and passing 602, bypassing 601.
3. where neither option 1 nor option 2 is available, students may arrange to have their competence certified by a qualified faculty member, usually through an informal examination.
Comprehensive Examination. during the semester following completion of the nonelective courses (which should be the fall term of the second year), students will form an examining committee of three faculty members in the department. it is expected that this committee will also serve as the M.A. thesis committee. The student will submit a prospectus of the M.A. thesis, as described below. The oral examination will assess the student’s mastery of topics from the first-year sequence of course work and gauge the merits of the prospectus.
Thesis. The master’s thesis (normally 50 to 100 pages in length) must be approved by a committee of the thesis director plus two other faculty members at the oral comprehensive exam. students form their thesis committee with the advice of their academic advisor, who may (but need not) be the thesis director. At the comprehensive oral exam for
the M.A., the department requires that students submit a prospectus
of the thesis. The prospectus should state clearly what problem is to be investigated, how the investigation is to be carried out (written research, fieldwork, experiment, etc.) and a preliminary bibliography. The prospectus should first be discussed with the thesis director. students should then submit a ‘clean’ version to all three committee members and set up a meeting where the prospectus may be informally discussed and approved (perhaps with modifications). students are also expected to consult their thesis director regularly during the actual writing of the thesis. formal requirements regarding the format and submission of the M.A. thesis are found in the Thesis and Dissertation Guide (gradschool. unc.edu/etdguide).
Final Oral Examination. This exam, administered by the thesis committee, focuses on a defense of the thesis, but the faculty reserves

The department of Marine sciences provides teaching and research
in estuarine, coastal, and oceanographic sciences, leading to M.s. and Ph.d. degrees in marine sciences. The two elements of the program are the department of Marine sciences (MAsC) located in Murray venable Hall on the Chapel Hill campus and the institute of Marine sciences (iMs) located on the waterfront in Morehead City, north Carolina. The department of Marine sciences is the degree granting unit; all marine sciences graduate students are enrolled in the department. Most iMs faculty have joint faculty appointments in the department, and this enables their participation in graduate student academic activities. research programs in physical oceanography, marine biology and ecology, marine geochemistry, marine geology and coastal meteorology are conducted in north Carolina and throughout the world by faculty from the department and the iMs.
Courses and facilities at other coastal laboratories are also available to UnC–Chapel Hill marine sciences students through cooperative agreements. Courses at north Carolina state University and at duke University may be taken for credit through an inter-institutional program.
each graduate student in the department of Marine sciences must
gain a broad background in the marine sciences as well as an in-
depth understanding of his or her own subdiscipline (e.g., chemical oceanography). This is accomplished by taking the four core courses, Marine Geology, Biological Oceanography, Chemical Oceanography, and Physical Oceanography (MAsC 503, 504, 505, and 506, respectively), and advanced courses determined by each student’s advisory committee, as well as by participating in research that ultimately results in an M.s. thesis or a Ph.d. dissertation. by the end of the 24-month period that begins when the student first enrolls in the department, the student
is expected to have completed the four core courses, How to Give a seminar (MAsC 705), interdisciplinary seminar (MAsC 706), and to have taken a written comprehensive exam (M.s. students) in his or her subdiscipline. further information on degree requirements may be found at www.marine.unc.edu, and are described below.
Requirements for Admission
for admission to the department of Marine sciences, an undergraduate degree is required in a basic science such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, bacteriology, botany, zoology, geology, or in
computer science or engineering. students are advised to develop a broad undergraduate science major with as many as possible of the following courses: mathematics through calculus, computer science, physics, general and organic chemistry, physical chemistry, invertebrate zoology or paleontology, botany, zoology, ecology, physiology, geology, and statistics.
Degree Requirements
Doctor of Philosophy. The academic program for a Ph.d. student will be supervised by a faculty advisory committee of at least five drawn from the UnC graduate faculty. Course requirements normally include the four core courses, additional advanced courses determined by the student’s advisory committee, one hour of MAsC 705 How to Give a Seminar and one hour of MAsC 706 Interdisciplinary Seminar. A waiver for one or more of the core courses can be arranged with approval of the student’s advisory committee and the department of Marine sciences Performance Committee. Additional requirements include passing a comprehensive examination containing both written (research proposal) and oral (proposal defense seminar) parts, a period of study or research at a marine station or participation on an oceanographic cruise, teaching experience sufficient to develop and demonstrate competence, and scientific research resulting in a written dissertation, which is defended by the student. More details on the Ph.d. comprehensive examination, admission to candidacy, semesters of residence credit, the dissertation, and final oral examination (the dissertation defense) are provided in the Marine Sciences Graduate Student Handbook and in The Graduate School Handbook (both available at marine.unc.edu).
Master of Science. The M.s. degree program is similar to the Ph.d. program except for the following: the advisory committee will be composed of three faculty members, the comprehensive examination is a written exam only, and scientific research will result in a written thesis, to be defended by the student. Additional details on the comprehensive examination, admission to candidacy, residence credit, the thesis, and final oral examination (the thesis defense) are provided in the Marine Sciences Graduate Student Handbook and in The Graduate School Handbook (both available at marine.unc.edu).

The department of Mathematics offers graduate training leading to the degrees of master of arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy. A master’s degree may be included or bypassed in the doctoral program. All of a student’s graduate work may be done within the department
or, when appropriate, may be done under the direction of an approved advisor in an allied discipline. The department of Mathematics is housed in Phillips Hall and Chapman Hall. The department of Mathematics offers a number of teaching assistantships and teaching fellowships each year. Applicants for financial aid are also considered for several University fellowships awarded by The Graduate school in the University-wide competition. Applications for admission and financial assistance may be obtained from The Graduate school. Applications filed by our posted deadline will receive full consideration.
Degree Requirements
The general regulations of The Graduate school govern the work for graduate degrees in mathematics. specific requirements are explained below. in general, a graduate student in mathematics may receive credit only for mathematics courses numbered 600 and above.
These descriptions summarize the requirements for the master’s and Ph.d. degrees. More detailed statements may be obtained from the department. The director of graduate studies must approve all aspects of a student’s program. The purpose of the graduate programs is to develop mathematical skills appropriate for competition in academia or industry.

￼The course schedule for first-year students will depend upon each student’s undergraduate training. The normal course load for a graduate student is three courses (nine credit hours) per semester. Graduate students must keep full time status in order to qualify for tuition and health insurance benefits. first-year students typically choose courses from five year-long sequences in algebra (676, 677), analysis (653, 656), geometry-topology (680, 681), scientific computation (661, 662), and methods of applied mathematics (668, 669). The Ph.d. comprehensive exams are based on the content of the first-year sequences. These exams are offered in January and August of each year, just before the semester begins. A Ph.d. student can pass either the Pure Math option or the Applied Math option for the qualifying examination. to pass the Pure Math option a student must pass any three of the five qualifying exams. to pass the Applied Math option, a student is required to pass Methods of Applied Math and scientific Computation.
during the second year a typical Ph.d. student will take the Ph.d. comprehensive exams and select courses from a list of 20 more advanced “second tier” courses. A typical master’s student will complete that degree during the second year. The department considers two years to be the normal time needed to complete a master’s degree.
A candidate for a master’s degree must satisfy each of the following requirements:
1. earn at least two semesters of residency credit and complete all
requirements within five years.
2. demonstrate computer programming ability by passing an approved undergraduate or graduate course in programming, or by passing an exam administered by the Mathematics department.
3. Perform satisfactorily in 30 hours of graduate work in a program approved by the director of graduate studies. At least 15 of these hours must be in Mathematics department courses numbered 600 or above.
4. Complete a master’s project or thesis for a master of science degree or a master’s thesis for a master of arts degree.
5. Pass an oral examination upon completion of the master’s project or master’s thesis. The exam will cover coursework as well as the project or thesis.
6. A master’s candidate must pass one of the written comprehensive exams given to doctoral students.
A candidate for a Ph.d. degree must satisfy each of the following requirements:
1. earn at least four semesters of residency credit and complete all
requirements within eight years.
2. satisfy the same computer programming requirement as a master’s student.
3. demonstrate reading competence in one approved foreign language by passing an approved course or by passing a translation exam administered by the Mathematics department.
4. Complete either the pure math option or the applied math option for qualifying examinations by the beginning of the sixth semester.
5. Pass at least six courses from the following two lists: a) the second
tier courses or b) first-year comprehensive courses that are not basic courses for any of the comprehensive exams passed by the student. of these six courses at least three must be numbered over 700 and drawn from the second tier list.
6. Pass the tA teaching seminar and perform a minimum of two semesters of instructional service.
7. Pass a preliminary oral exam on the chosen Ph.d. specialty area.
8. write a Ph.d. thesis and defend it successfully during a final oral exam chaired by the thesis advisor.
The student/faculty ratio of about 2/1 makes it possible for graduate students to take reading courses from individual faculty members that are tailored to meet the student’s needs.
Minor in Mathematics
Graduate students in other departments who plan to offer mathematics as a (complete or partial) minor field for the Ph.d. should consult
the director of graduate studies in mathematics for approval of their programs and for assignment of an advisor in the department of Mathematics. This should be done at the earliest possible time, in order to prevent disappointment for the student.

The department of Microbiology and immunology, an administrative division of the school of Medicine, is a unit of The Graduate school. it offers instruction leading to the doctor of philosophy degree. A terminal master of science degree is granted only under special conditions. The department is highly regarded in many scientific disciplines, including immunology, microbial pathogenesis, virology, infectious diseases, host/ pathogen interactions, molecular genetics, prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecular and cellular biology, and cancer biology.. research in the department is supported by funds from the University, the national institutes of Health, the national science foundation, the American Cancer society, and other private foundations and granting agencies.
for detailed information, visit the department’s web site at med.unc. edu/microimm.
Program of Study
As is the case for all graduate students in the basic science departments of the UnC school of Medicine, education during the first year is under the guidance of the interdisciplinary biological and biomedical sciences Program (bbsP). students rotate through three different research laboratories of their choosing in year one. for students interested in microbiology and immunology, recommended classroom courses include immunobiology (MCro 614), virology (MCro 630), Microbial Pathogenesis i (MCro 635), and Microbial Pathogenesis ii (MCro 640).
￼vaccines, inflammation, Microbial immunology
Upon choosing a dissertation lab and joining the department of Microbiology and immunology, students are provided with an outstanding learning environment, an opportunity to conduct cutting- edge research, and most importantly, thorough preparation for a successful career in science. The Microbiology and immunology Ph.d. program is designed to provide a foundation of fundamental knowledge in modern microbiology and immunology, foster critical scientific thinking, develop written and oral communication skills, allow students to gain teaching experience, and offer opportunities to travel and present posters or talks at national meetings. specific components of the Microbiology and immunology Ph.d. training program include:
Completion of six relevant courses, including two courses based directly on discussion of the primary literature (e.g. MCro 710, MCro 711, MCro 712), is required. students typically finish four of the six classes while in bbsP and the remainder during year two. There is no language requirement.
The doctoral Preliminary examination (typically at the end of year two) is a non-thesis research proposal in the format of an niH grant application. Many students prepare by taking the MCro 795 writing class in year two. The exam is intended to be an assessment of each student’s ability to formulate an original and independent experimental approach and adequately express his or her ideas in writing.
The doctoral oral Preliminary examination (typically at the start of year three) is an oral defense of the written research proposal. The oral exam provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their ability to discuss the fields of science related to their proposal, as well as their ability to analyze problems and design experiments.
students must regularly attend weekly student and departmental seminars beginning in year two and present their research annually in the student seminar series beginning in year three.
students act as a teaching Assistant for two semesters in department- approved courses, typically in years two and three.
students form a dissertation committee in the middle of year three, obtain approval of their dissertation project, and meet annually with their committee to discuss research progress. Completion of sufficient original research for at least two first author papers in high-quality refereed journals is expected. At a minimum, authorship on at least two manuscripts (one accepted for publication), with peer reviews returned for at least one first-author research paper, is required. After writing a dissertation, students undergo a final oral examination and present their research in a public seminar. The Ph.d. degree is typically completed in five to six years.
Research Environment
rooms dedicated to tissue culture, controlled temperature environments, bsl3 physical containment for research on microbial select agents, supervised animal care, etc. in addition, the University operates an extensive network of core facilities with major equipment and expert support staff, including flow cytometry, genomics, proteomics, oligonucleotide synthesis, dnA sequencing, X-ray crystallography, nMr, animal models (transgenic mouse and embryonic stem cell services), animal histopathology, bioinformatics, gene chips, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry.
The department is fully supplied with high-speed internet connections (both wired and wireless). University libraries provide electronic access to thousands of professional journals.
Admission
students seeking admission to the department of Microbiology and immunology apply to bbsP, a common portal by which students interested in any of the 14 participating graduate programs begin their studies at UnC. to apply, visit www.med.unc.edu/bbsp and gradschool. unc.edu/admissions, fill out the online application, and select Microbiology and immunology as your first choice of interest.
Financial Assistance
All Ph.d. students making satisfactory degree progress receive a stipend plus in-state tuition, fees, and health insurance. funds are available from individual research grants, training grants, the department, and the University. students are encouraged to apply for a pre-doctoral fellowship from the national institute of Health, the national science foundation, or other organizations.

MUsiC 245
￼￼MUsC 750 (resources and Methods in Musicology) is required of all M.A. students in their first semester, as is MUsC 992 (Master’s Thesis) in the fourth semester. other courses are drawn from a range of offerings comprising proseminars (repertory-, method-, or issue-based studies) and seminars (on more precise topics normally requiring significant research on primary sources). Graduate students have the option to include courses from other departments that may be organized as a formal minor (nine hours for the M.A., 15 for the Ph.d.) or as a supporting program. Courses taken outside the department must be approved in advance
by the director of graduate studies in music and by the departments concerned as directly relevant to a proposed course of study.
M.A. candidates take courses totaling 30 credit hours and write a thesis that is a revision and expansion of a paper prepared for a graduate seminar taken in the music department. All candidates for a master’s degree take a final oral examination covering course work; a final written examination is not given.
students entering with an equivalent M.A. from another institution are required to take MUsC 750 (resources and Methods in Musicology) in their first semester, in addition to five proseminars or seminars in the department at the graduate level during their first, probationary year.
At the beginning of each spring semester a qualifying examination is given to those who wish to proceed to the Ph.d. program after gaining the M.A. students already in the department’s M.A. program take the examination in the second year. Those who received the M.A. at another institution must take the examination in the spring of their first year of study.
following the completion of an additional 12 hours of seminars above the 30 hours required for the M.A., Ph.d. students take a written examination in an area of specialization to be determined through consultation with the faculty and director of graduate studies in music. in the sixth semester of study (fourth semester for those with a M.A. from another institution), Ph.d. students must meet the second language requirement and take an oral examination on a proposed dissertation topic. They then register for at least two semesters of MUsC 994 (doctoral dissertation) and MUsC 994’s co-requisite MUsC 991 (dissertation Colloquium), complete the dissertation, and undergo a second oral examination in its defense.
More detailed explanation of these requirements appears in the Music department’s Graduate Handbook (music.unc.edu/graduate/grad_ degree_info/handbook).

The Curriculum in neurobiology at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill is a broadly-based interdisciplinary graduate training program in the neurosciences. with 80 active faculty, strong research funding, and a long and successful training history, the Curriculum ranks among the best programs in the country.
our program has 70 primary faculty members who can serve as dissertation advisors. research opportunities in the curriculum are supported by the presence of an active neuroscience community at UnC–Chapel Hill. This community includes members of every basic science department in the school of Medicine, members of many clinical departments, as well as several departments in the Arts and sciences. University research and clinical centers with a neuroscience component also contribute to the vibrant and active community that makes neurobiology a major intellectual focus at UnC–Chapel Hill.
The neurobiology Curriculum has an average of 45 students at different levels of training at any given time; typically 5–8 students are accepted each year depending on available funding. students in the Curriculum are supported during their first 1–2 years by a long-standing training grant funded through ninds and niMH, and in subsequent years
by either their mentor’s research grants or individual fellowships. The average time to graduation is 5.3 years.
neuroscience is by its very nature an interdisciplinary endeavor, and
at UnC–Chapel Hill the Curriculum in neurobiology provides a broadly structured training curriculum and research environment that spans the range from genetic studies of the nervous system through the complexities of human cognitive function

II. Communicating Scientifics Results Seminar in Neurobiology (NBIO 850)
This class employs faculty coaching and peer critiquing to develop students’ skills in speaking and writing about science with ease, clarity, and precision. The class aims to build self-confidence and the ability
to take criticism without defensiveness. it meets once a week for 1.25 hours for both semesters. students take this course for two semesters; second-year students are paired with first-year students as mentors, as rehearsal partners, and as editing partners for written assignments. The class size is approximately 16 students. each session is coached by two faculty members, Ann stuart and an invited neurobiology or cell and molecular physiology faculty member. Thus, the class also provides a mechanism for expanded student-faculty bonding, reinforced by a social event at the end of each semester.
two elective specialty courses and three research apprenticeships (via bbsP) in different laboratories fulfill the course requirement. The courses menu lists descriptions of these core courses of the neurobiology Curriculum; other selected offerings are shown under the “electives.” Additional elective courses in biochemistry, statistics, molecular biology,

Master of Science in Nursing
The Master of science in nursing (M.s.n.) program prepares nurses for advanced practice nursing focused on direct patient care or as advanced specialists in health care systems
Length of Program
The program of study varies from 32 to 46 credits of academic course work including clinical practice, a professional portfolio as a substitute for the oral comprehensive examination, and a master’s paper (or in some cases, a thesis). students may pursue the M.s.n. degree on a full- time or part-time basis.
Master’s Program Curriculum
The curriculum consists of four components: the professional core, the research core, the clinical core, and the advanced nursing practice core courses. The professional core courses (nUrs 646, nUrs 647) and research core courses (nUrs 778, nUrs 779, nUrs 992 or 993) are required of most M.s.n. students. The clinical core courses and advanced practice area courses focus on the student’s selected area of specialization and role preparation.
The program options offered reflect a combination of current practice trends as well as available faculty resources. . in some advanced practice specialty areas, electives in nursing or other disciplines or courses
to support a focus area are required. each student is admitted to a specific advanced practice area and assigned a faculty advisor to design a program of study that is appropriate to the student’s educational and career goals. Upon completion of the program, students are eligible to sit for national certification examinations appropriate to their advanced area of preparation.
The current advanced practice nursing population foci include adult/ gerontology nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner, pediatric nurse practitioner/primary care, and psychiatric-mental health nursing nurse practitioner.

The division of occupational science and occupational Therapy in the department of Allied Health sciences offers two graduate programs: a master of science (M.s.) degree with a major in occupational therapy (ot) and a doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.) degree in occupational science. The M.s. in occupational therapy program is a two-year program designed for individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a
field other than occupational therapy. it is an entry-level program for individuals who wish to become occupational therapists. The Ph.d. program in occupational science accepts applicants with an earned master’s degree in occupational therapy or a related field (see admission requirements below). The doctoral program prepares individuals who wish to pursue academic careers that could include teaching, research, and other scholarly activities related to occupational science and occupational therapy.
Requirements for Admission into the M.S. Program in Occupational Therapy
1. bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution
2. submission of Graduate record examination (Gre) scores from the educational testing service
3. Academic record that demonstrates potential to do work at the graduate level
4. Completion of the ot supplemental application
The M.S. program has the following prerequisites:
There are eight total prerequisite courses, four of which are fixed (core body of knowledge) and four of which come from a flexible and diverse menu of categories. All prerequisites except the occupation course must be taken for credit in an accredited academic institution of higher learning
Fixed Prerequisites
1. Human anatomy with a lab * 2. Human physiology*
3. Abnormal psychology
4. introductory statistics
* a two-semester sequence of combined anatomy and physiology; parts i and ii may be substituted for separate courses.
Flexible Prerequisites
1. Human/individual behavior (for example: developmental psychology, child development, adulthood and aging, cognitive psychology, neuropsychology)
2. Modes of reasoning (for example: philosophy and ethics, statistics
or data analysis [beyond the introductory course], religion, literature taught in a foreign language, research design or method of inquiry in a social science)
3. study of social relationships, institutions and systems (for example: linguistics, cultural/social anthropology, sociology, public health, public policy, leisure studies, social work, political science, minority studies)
4. occupation: Complete a course in either an academic or community- based setting that requires the skills of your body as well as your mind. The occupation prerequisite must have the following characteristics:
• new learning/challenge (not something you already do or know how to do)
• formal (structured) learning context, but does not have to be a “for credit” course
• at least once a week for a minimum of 6 weeks
• social context (other learners present in person; online courses are not accepted)
• results in an end product or performance
• learners must be active (not just recipients of information)
• course content is not designed to be used to benefit, teach or communicate with others
examples includecreative writing, poetry writing, studio art class, woodworking, jewelry making, theatre, dance, music, and some sports.)
The master of science program requires a minimum of 63 semester credit hours. The program is 24 months in length and includes substantial fieldwork experience.
occupational therapy courses are available only to graduate students enrolled in the M.s. program at the University.
Requirements for Admission into the Ph.D. Program in Occupational Science
The Ph.d. program in occupational science accepts academically qualified applicants who have completed master degrees in occupational therapy, relevant social and behavioral sciences or related health fields. Applicants receive a thorough review for evidence of potential success
in a doctoral program in The Graduate school at UnC–Chapel Hill. in order to achieve closely mentored research experiences, only applicants with expressed interests consistent with existing programs of research and scholarly work of the faculty are admitted. final selection among qualified applicants will be based on his or her interview with core faculty members in the Ph.d. program in occupational science. review the UnC–Chapel Hill web site for information about applying to The Graduate school. in addition to the formal application to The Graduate school, the following information is required:
1. Copies of all undergraduate and graduate transcripts
2. Graduate record examination (Gre) scores (taken within the last five years)
3. results of the toefl (test of english as a foreign language, if applicable)
￼
4. A reflective essay detailing personal and professional goals relevant to the pursuit of a Ph.d. in occupational science at UnC–Chapel Hill (submit directly to the division of occupational science) and
5. Three letters of recommendation from individuals that support the applicant’s potential as an educator and scholar (sent to the division)
The Ph.d. program requires a minimum of 45 semester credit hours beyond the master’s degree. This course of study covers four domains: a) occupational science, b) an interdisciplinary cognate area that complements occupational science, c) research design and methodology and d) competencies for an academic career. All graduates must complete a doctoral dissertation in occupational science. students are also expected to reach satisfactory competence in teaching and research as determined by their career goals.
with approval from the instructor, occupational science courses
are open to graduate students interested in 1) the study of people engaged in everyday activities in different situations and 2) how various experiences in an activity or patterns of engagement influence development, health, and quality of life across the lifespan.

The department of Pharmacology offers a program of study that leads to the degree of doctor of philosophy in pharmacology. The curriculum is individualized in recognition of the diverse backgrounds and interests of students and the broad scope of the discipline of pharmacology. The basic course requirements for the Ph.d. degree include introductory and advanced courses in pharmacology and related programs in accord with the principal interest of the students in molecular pharmacology, neuropharmacology, or in toxicology. in addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of the department and The Graduate school, the student must pass written and oral doctoral examinations, write a dissertation based on original research, and submit to a final oral examination. Under special circumstances, the department will offer a program leading to the M.s. degree. The requirements are appropriate course work, a written comprehensive examination, a thesis based on original research, and a final oral examination.
The department offers a variety of research areas including 1) receptors and signal transduction, 2) ion channels, 3) neuropharmacology, 4) cancer pharmacology, 5) gene therapy, and 6) pharmacology of alcohol and drugs of abuse. The student is expected to begin independent research early in his or her training and to participate in an intensive program of research seminars. Close personal contact between preceptor and trainee is encouraged.
Research Facilities
laboratory facilities and a wide variety of research equipment are available in the department, which is located primarily in the Genetic Medicine building, where it occupies approximately 30,000 square feet (exclusive of classrooms and animal facilities). in addition, several faculty members are located in the lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Thurston bowles Alcohol Center, and the neurosciences building.
Assistantships and Other Student Aid
financial assistance is provided to all students. The stipend for the 2013–2014 fiscal year will be $27,500 per year. in addition, tuition, fees and health insurance coverage are provided.
training faculty participate fully at all levels. The department has the highest level of niH funding of all pharmacology departments and
a great diversity of research areas is available to trainees. These areas include: cell surface receptors, G proteins, protein kinases and signal transduction mechanisms; neuropharmacology; nucleic acids, cancer, and antimicrobial pharmacology; and experimental therapeutics. Cell and molecular approaches are particularly strong, but systems-level research such as behavioral pharmacology and analysis of knock-in and knock-out mice is also well-represented. excellent physical facilities are available for all research areas.
students completing the training program will have acquired basic knowledge of pharmacology and related fields, in-depth knowledge in their dissertation research area, the ability to evaluate scientific literature, mastery of a variety of laboratory procedures, skill in planning and executing an important research project in pharmacology, and the ability to communicate results, analysis, and interpretation. These skills provide a sound basis for successful scientific careers in academia, government, or industry.

The graduate program in philosophy is designed to equip students to engage with both perennial and cutting edge philosophical enquiry. The program is intended to prepare students for college and university positions in philosophy.
The department of Philosophy offers a program of study leading to the Ph.d. in philosophy. Prerequisite for admission to graduate work in
the department is a b.A. degree or equivalent, typically with a major in philosophy, with a broad range of courses. students earn an M.A. as part of the Ph.d. program.
Candidates for the master’s degree must satisfactorily complete 30 semester hours of graduate work. They are normally required to participate in a first-year program including PHil 700 and PHil 455; there may be adjustments with the consent of the department. successfully completing an M.A. thesis is a condition for receiving the degree of master of arts.
Candidates for the doctoral degree must satisfactorily complete 60 semester hours of graduate work, including six hours of Ph.d. dissertation credit.
The candidate for the degree of doctor of philosophy must pass two examinations. first, there is the Admission to Candidacy examination, which itself has two parts—a written general portion and a special oral portion. The written portion, normally taken in the spring term of the third year, is in the student’s field of specialization. The oral portion tests the feasibility of the dissertation proposal and is normally taken in the fall term of the fourth year. second, there is an oral defense of the completed dissertation. for further details on degree requirements, see the Graduate degree requirements section of this catalog.
The department offers several nonservice fellowships. These include the Graham Kenan fellowship and the Horace williams, Mary taylor williams, and bertha Colton williams fellowships. The department has available teaching assistantships with stipends of over $15,000.
in addition, The Graduate school offers a variety of fellowships and assistantships with stipends up to $22,000 that are open to students in philosophy.
The department maintains close relations with the department of Philosophy at duke University. Graduate students in either institution may register for credit in graduate courses or seminars at the other
institution and may have faculty from either on their dissertation committees. library facilities are available to students at each institution.
More information about our program can be found on our department web site, philosophy.unc.edu.

The department of Physics and Astronomy offers graduate work leading to the degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy.
The active fields of research are biophysics, medical physics, condensed-matter physics, materials physics, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, neutrino physics and nuclear astrophysics, quantum field theory, theoretical particle physics, general relativity and gravitation, extragalactic and stellar astronomy, and astrophysics. students can also work in the UnC–Chapel Hill biophysics program, or they can study under any advisor so long as the research project is supervised by a committee that contains a majority of UnC–Chapel Hill Physics and Astronomy faculty. The graduate courses are designed to give students a broad foundation and to introduce them to the special fields in which the research interests of the department lie.
The general regulations of The Graduate school govern the work for the degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy. to begin a graduate program in physics or astrophysics, the student should have completed most of the requirements for the degree of bachelor of science with a major in physics at the University, or their equivalent elsewhere. The minimum prerequisite for graduate study consists of the basic undergraduate courses PHys 116, 117, 128, 128l, 301, 302, 341, 415, 311, and 312, together with MAtH 232, 233, and 528. At the end of the spring semester a student must take the Ph.d. written examination. The examination is based upon the graduate student’s first-year course work and will cover dynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electromagnetic theory.
The M.s. degree in physics may be taken with or without thesis. However, even if a thesis is not submitted, a student must work with a research group for at least one semester, in order to learn the
research techniques in a field of physics or astronomy. if the research is theoretical, the student must also gain experimental experience. A minor is not required for the M.s. degree, but one may be chosen in accord with the regular graduate requirements for this option. The equivalent of one semester teaching experience is required of all M.s. degree candidates. The M.s. astrophysics track must include Astr 701 and a minimum of six hours from Astr 519, 702, 703 or 704.
The requirements for a Ph.d. in physics are a) successful completion
of the following core courses in the department, or completion of their equivalents elsewhere as an undergraduate or graduate student: 701, 711, 712, 741, 721, and 722; b) passing the Ph.d. written examination based on core graduate courses in physics as listed in a), c) gaining experimental experience either through master’s or doctoral research,
or (if student’s research is theoretical) by performing an experimental project deemed adequate by the director of graduate studies, d) taking
a course outside his or her field of specialization from a list approved
by the director of graduate studies and e) passing at least three other advanced graduate-level courses appropriate to his or her field of specialization. A Ph.d. candidate must also take a preliminary doctoral oral examination within the first three years of graduate study in physics at UnC–Chapel Hill. The oral examination is concerned mainly with the student’s dissertation research project. A minor is not required, but may be elected, in which case requirement c) above is replaced by the requirement that the student pass at least five graduate-level courses selected from no more than two departments, with no fewer than two courses in either department. The minor program must be approved
in advance by the minor department. teaching experience, as part
of professional training, is required of all doctoral candidates. This experience can be gained through laboratory or lecture instruction as a teaching assistant, either for two semesters or until teaching competence is acquired.
The astrophysics Ph.d. track requirements are similar except that
the course requirements are PHys 701, 711, 721, 741 and Astr
701, 702, 703, 704, 705 and an additional 700-level course. to gain familiarity with experimental astrophysics or observational astronomy, a student must pass Astr 519/719, earn an M.s. degree which involves experimental or observational research in astrophysics, or perform other experimental/observational research deemed suitable by the director of graduate studies.
Research Interests
Astronomy and Astrophysics. research includes the formation, structure, and evolution of stars, our Milky way galaxy, other galaxies, gamma ray bursters and cosmology. Theory involves numerical relativity and sources of gravitational radiation, stellar seismology and quasars, and interstellar medium physics. UnC–Chapel Hill has guaranteed observing time on the 4.1-meter soAr telescope in Chile, which began regular operations in 2004, and on the 11-meter sAlt telescope in south Africa, which began operations in 2005. UnC–Chapel Hill operates a number of smaller robotic telescopes as well.
Biological and Medical Physics. experimental studies include manipulation and force measurement techniques with applications to dnA, molecular motors, cells, and cilia; hydration effects in adsorption of biochemicals. There is also a strong focus on the theoretical and experimental translational research in medical imaging technologies, including radiotherapy instruments based on carbon nanotube X-ray emitters such as single-cell irradiation and in vivo micro-Ct; optical coherence tomography using nanoparticle molecular imaging agents; systems level implementation of tomographic imaging instruments.

Facilities and Equipment
research in physics and astronomy is carried out in laboratories on and off the Chapel Hill campus. within Phillips Hall and Chapman Hall there are several major research laboratories including the “nanomanipulator” (a combination of a scanning electron microscope, an atomic force microscope, and sophisticated visualization graphics), the Keck laboratory for Atomic imaging and Manipulation, which includes two transmission electron microscopes, and the Goodman laboratory for Astronomical instrumentation. other facilities include apparatus for nuclear magnetic resonance studies, scanning probe microscopes, and raman and optical spectrometers. for synthesis
and fabrication, major facilities include molecular beam epitaxy, microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, laser ablation, and photolithography and reactive ion etching. resources for highly parallel computing are provided by UnC’s information and technology services, as well as by national centers.
The department is a partner in the triangle Universities nuclear laboratory and plays a major role in experiments using the laboratory for experimental nuclear Astrophysics (lenA), tandem Accelerator, and the High-intensity Gamma-ray source at the free electron laser facility. UnC–Chapel Hill has an active program in low-background physics
at the KUrf underground facility near blacksburg, vA. UnC–Chapel Hill has a 0.6-meter on-campus telescope, and is a major partner in the 4.1-meter soAr telescope in Chile and the 11-meter southern African large telescope (sAlt) in south Africa. The department operates the ProMPt array of robotic telescopes in Chile and manages the skynet array of robotic telescopes. numerous national laboratories, including oak ridge, brookhaven, nist, los Alamos and Argonne, as well as KamlAnd, nrAo, noAo, the Hubble space telescope, and the Chandra X-ray observatory, are also vital parts of our research efforts.
Fellowships and Assistantships
Many teaching assistantships (with stipends of $17,100 for nine months) are available to qualified graduate students. summer employment is usually available. The duties of assistants include supervising laboratory classes in elementary physics or astronomy, assisting in the supervision of advanced laboratories, teaching recitation sections, and grading papers. Graduate school fellowships are available for well-qualified applicants to the department’s graduate program. teaching assistants can usually be supported in the summer by teaching or research.
research assistantships are also offered, especially to those who have completed a year or two of graduate work. The stipend is $22,800 for the calendar year.
Application forms for admission, including graduate appointments, should be completed online at gradschool.unc.edu/admissions.

The political science graduate program is small and very selective: each year about 15 students enroll. Most graduate students pursue the doctor of philosophy in political science. However, the department also offers courses of study leading to the master of arts in political science and the master of arts in political science with a certificate in latin American studies.
￼￼

￼Admission
The general prerequisite for admission to graduate study is a bachelor of arts degree or equivalent. A student is not required to have an undergraduate major in political science but will normally be expected to have had at least nine semester hours of course work in political science.
All applicants for admission to graduate study must take the Graduate record examination (Gre). Prospective applicants should take the test early enough to enable them to submit official reports of scores with their application for admission. in considering applications for fellowship awards, these test scores receive heavy emphasis. Applicants are encouraged to have their applications complete by december 1 and no later than posted deadlines. Applicants are also required to submit a writing sample and a personal statement.
Graduate Study in Political Science
departmental programs of graduate study are intended to train professional political scientists. Thus, graduate work is expected to be qualitatively different from undergraduate work. its emphasis is upon the acquisition of tools, skills, and knowledge at a level to qualify
the student to: carry on research, to teach, to fill active political and administrative duties, and to carry on other roles that advance the profession of practicing political scientists.
All candidates for graduate degrees will be expected to achieve broad mastery at the professional level of the literature, problems, and skills of the academic fields and subfields offered for the degree, and will have gained experience in teaching and research. Much more is required of the candidate than mere compilation of credits in relevant courses.
At the M.A. level, the student is required, in addition to passing the course programs successfully, to write a thesis and to be examined orally on the major field of interest and in defense of the thesis.
At the doctoral level, preliminary examinations are both written and oral, in that order. written examinations are given twice each year,
in september and in March. The final part of the examination is an
oral defense of the dissertation proposal. successful completion of
these examinations permits a student to become a doctoral candidate. following completion of the dissertation, a final oral examination will be held, which is primarily a defense of the dissertation but may include such excursions into underlying theory and related fields as are germane to the dissertation.
Field and Course Requirements
The political science curriculum is designed to ensure that graduate students develop a professional competence in the discipline as a whole, as well as expertise in one major and one minor field. The courses in the department are grouped under the following broad categories: international relations, comparative politics, political theory, American politics, methodology, and public policy/public administration (minor field only).
Ph.d. students are required to demonstrate competence in two fields of study and, by participating in the instructional program, to undergo training as teachers. A minimum of four courses and a comprehensive examination is required in the major field. A comprehensive examination and three courses are required in the minor field.
The Institute of Latin American Studies and the Graduate Certificate
The institute of latin American studies and the Consortium in latin American studies at UnC–Chapel Hill and duke University serve
as a medium for interdisciplinary communication on latin America, encouraging and stimulating instruction and research on the region.
They provide funding for interdisciplinary working groups, visiting scholars, research workshops, and guest lectures, as well as support for graduate students through academic year and summer fellowships and research and conference travel grants. The program has been funded as a national resource (title vi) Center since 1991 by the U.s. department of education.
Although the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill does not grant an interdisciplinary postgraduate degree in latin American studies, graduate students seeking to document their area expertise
are encouraged to earn a certificate in latin American studies in conjunction with any advanced degree in any University graduate program. The requirements for the certificate are 1) a minimum of
two semesters of residence, 2) language competence in spanish or Portuguese, 3) four graduate courses on latin American topics, 4) a thesis on a topic related to latin America, and 5) an oral defense of the thesis. for students in professional schools or departments that do not require defense of a thesis, a letter from the student’s advisor indicating that a major research project on a latin American topic was successfully completed will be sufficient to waive the requirement. Graduate students interested in obtaining a certificate in latin American studies should contact the director of the institute of latin American studies.
The Center for European Studies
The Center for european studies (Ces) and the european Union Center of excellence (eUCe) provide a focus for interdisciplinary and political research on europe by funding faculty course development, research projects, research working groups, and travel as well as funding graduate student research, travel, and foreign language learning. in recent years the center has hosted international conferences on the european Union, regional regimes, comparative social policy, and
the political economy of capitalist democracies as well as hosting
three doctoral dissertation workshops in conjunction with european universities. Graduate students are always closely involved in our conferences and activities. The center has established a master’s
degree program with tracks in transatlantic relations and european Governance in consortium with european and American universities. Ces is funded as a national resource Center by the U.s. department of education and as a european Union Center of excellence by the european Commission. we are also network coordinators for all commission-funded eU centers in the United states.
Center for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies
The Center for slavic, eurasian, and east european studies (Cseees) is an interdisciplinary center run jointly with a sister center at duke University. in addition to offering an undergraduate major in russian and east european studies, the center actively promotes graduate education and research in this area of the world.
As a U.s. department of education title vi Center, Cseees awards foreign language and Area studies (flAs) fellowships to a few graduate students each academic year and summer to help them acquire the language skills and area expertise necessary for advanced study and field research in this part of the world.
The Louis Harris Data Center
The national polling company Harris interactive (formerly louis Harris & Associates) has been surveying Americans’ opinions on issues of national importance since the late 1950s. Harris surveys cover many topics, including national morale, the arts, energy policy, women’s roles, political candidates, violence, health, and housing. The breadth and scope of the Harris surveys make them a rich source for secondary analysis by social scientists.
￼
in 1965, louis Harris agreed to make his data available for secondary analysis by researchers. Harris and the University of north Carolina jointly agreed to establish at Chapel Hill the louis Harris data Center as the national archive for all Harris data. since 1965, more than 200 national, state, and community studies conducted by Harris interactive have been deposited at the Harris data Center for use by researchers at the University and elsewhere.
Publications
The James sprunt studies in History and Political science, established by the late dr. James sprunt, of wilmington, north Carolina, is published under the direction of the departments involved.

According to U.S. News and World Report’s 2012 rankings, the school is #2 of all public health schools in the U.s. and the top public school of public health. The school’s mission is to improve public health, promote individual well-being and eliminate health disparities across north Carolina and around the world.
Accredited by the Council on education for Public Health (CePH), the public health school offers undergraduate and graduate programs on campus near UnC’s schools of medicine, nursing, dentistry and pharmacy, and through its state-of-the-art onlineeducation programs. The school’s Michael Hooker research Center and many renovated labs and classrooms provide an environment highly conducive to the dissemination and development of public health knowledge.
(see www.sph.unc.edu/rooms.)
beyond campus, members of the Gillings school of Global Public Health faculty teach, conduct research, and serve communities across the state and nation and around the world. The office of Global Health oversees efforts in more than fifty-five countries. The north Carolina institute for Public Health, the school’s service and outreach arm, brings public health scholarship and practice communities together. research and innovation solutions (www.sph.unc.edu/accelerate), an initiative funded by a generous gift from dennis Gillings and Joan Gillings, aids in the anticipation of new public health challenges and the acceleration of solutions and delivery of best practices to improve people’s lives.
to learn more about the field, visit www.whatispublichealth.org. developed by the Association of schools of Public Health, the site describes public health, its effect on people’s lives locally and globally, and the variety of public health careers.
departments and curricula in the Gillings school of Global Public Health are:
• Biostatistics*
• Environmental Sciences and Engineering* • Epidemiology
• Health Behavior
• Health Policy and Management*
• Maternal and Child Health
• Nutrition*
• Public Health Leadership Program
All departments have graduate degree programs, and four (marked with *) offer degrees for undergraduates.
interdisciplinary programs that provide additional opportunities for students in public health-related education, service, and research include: the Carolina Population Center, the Cecil G. sheps Center for Health services research, the Center for environmental Health and susceptibility, the Center for Health Promotion and disease Prevention,
the Clinical nutrition research Center, the injury Prevention research Center, the UnC lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, the north Carolina institute for Public Health, the north Carolina occupational safety and Health education resource Center, and the north Carolina Center for Public Health Preparedness.
Graduate academic degrees offered by the school are the master
of science (M.s.) and the doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.). Graduate professional degrees include the master of science in public health (M.s.P.H.), master of science in environmental engineering (M.s.e.e.), master of public health (M.P.H.), master of healthcare administration (M.H.A.), master of science in clinical research (M.s.C.r.) and doctor of public health (dr.P.H.). All degree requirements are administered by the faculty of the Gillings school of Global Public Health with approval from The Graduate school’s Administrative board.
M.P.H. Degree
The master of public health degree is designed to prepare students for positions requiring a considerable breadth of knowledge in the field of public health and a lesser degree of specialization in one area. students in this degree program may take nearly half of their courses outside
of the major department or curriculum and undergo extensive field training (if previous experience is not deemed sufficient by criteria set by the student’s department or curriculum). typically, master of public health students already have acquired education in a health or health- related profession, or have at least three years’ experience in a field related to public health. The paster of public health is often a terminal degree, and qualified students may proceed in the Gillings school of Global Public Health to a dr.P.H. or Ph.d. program for further study.
M.S.P.H. Degree
The master of science in public health is designed to prepare students for professional careers in specialized areas of public health and health policy. students in this degree program typically take courses primarily in one major department or curriculum in the Gillings school of Global Public Health. Core requirements provide for orientation to a broader view of public health. The master of science in public health is usually a terminal degree; however, students may use this degree or the master of science (more so than the master of public health) as a precursor to a doctoral program. Programs of study leading to the M.s.P.H. degree are offered by the following departments: environmental sciences and engineering, health policy and management, and maternal and child health.
M.H.A. Degree
The master of healthcare administration, offered by the health policy and management department, is designed to prepare students for management careers in health-care organizations. Graduates will be prepared to take positions as staff members, managers or consultants for hospitals, health-maintenance organizations, clinics, public health departments and other health-care settings. Courses focusing on health- care services are supplemented with core courses offering a broader view of public health.
M.S. Degree
The master of science degree is offered in the departments of biostatistics, environmental sciences and engineering, and nutrition, and in the public health leadership program.
M.S.E.E. Degree
The curriculum leading to the M.s.e.e. is designed to prepare graduates for careers in the environmental engineering profession with special emphasis on water resources and air and industrial hygiene. specifically, students awarded this degree are prepared for professional work with private firms of consulting engineers; with public agencies at the
GlobAl PUbliC HeAltH 293
￼￼￼
294 www.UnC.edU/GrAdreCord
￼national, state, regional, and local levels of government; and with a variety of industrial organizations.
M.S.C.R. Degree
The master of science in clinical research is offered through the epidemiology department. it is intended to complement the substantive training in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and other health affairs disciplines by enhancing the student’s ability to apply appropriate research methodologies to his or her chosen or established field of research. Applicants will be required to demonstrate a clear relationship with a mentor in this field of research to provide content-area guidance during the program.
Dr.P.H. Degree
The doctor of public health provides professional training to prepare students effectively to conduct or supervise research, usually of an applied nature. Graduates also are prepared to integrate new knowledge and techniques into community and/or public health practice. Graduates typically are employed by operating community or public health programs at the local, state, national or international level. Programs of study leading to the dr.P.H. degree are offered by the following departments: biostatistics, health policy and management (distance learning format), maternal and child health, and nutrition.
Ph.D. Degree
The doctor of philosophy prepares students for leadership in academic and related settings involving teaching and research. students learn how to develop and apply theories for understanding public health, health care services, and policy. Graduates typically are employed by universities or other organizations conducting research. This degree
is offered in the departments of biostatistics, environmental sciences and engineering, epidemiology, health behavior, health policy and management, maternal and child health, and nutrition. The precursor to the Ph.d. degree is typically (although not exclusively) an M.s.P.H. degree, if the research is oriented to public health, or an M.s. degree.
Dual-Degree Programs
A number of dual-degree programs are offered in select departments. Under the dual-degree arrangement, a student may earn two professional degrees in a period of time less than the total required
by the two degrees separately. Medical students may pursue a dual degree through the departments of epidemiology, health policy and management, maternal and child health or nutrition, or through the public health leadership. dentistry, business, law, city and regional planning, and information and library science students may enroll in dual-degree programs through the department of Health Policy and Management. A dual degree also is offered through the department of Maternal and Child Health, in conjunction with the school of social work, and between the department of Health behavior and Health education and the department of City and regional Planning.
Online Education
executive Master’s Program: The department of Health Policy and Management provides graduate-level education to employed health professionals and health administrators through its executive master’s program. This national program provides master’s degree study to full- time health professionals throughout the United states and beyond. This program is comprised of intensive summer institutes on the Chapel Hill campus, faculty-guided distance learning and credit transfer from approved programs at other universities.
The leadership M.P.H. is offered through the public health leadership program. This degree is designed for individuals who already have a professional identity. Applicants will have three to five years’ health-
related experience and will desire to broaden knowledge and skills in public health philosophy and sciences. Applicants come from a variety of professional disciplines and have a range of experiences.
online master of science in public health (M.s.P.H.) and master of public health (M.P.H.) degrees in maternal and child health leadership will be offered through the department of Maternal and Child Health. both online degree programs are designed for individuals with work experience who want more graduate-level training in the field of maternal and child health. All course work is conducted online, except a required three-day intensive workshop on the Chapel Hill campus.
The doctoral program in health leadership (dr.P.H.) is available through the department of Health Policy and Management. This program, the only one of its kind in the U.s.,prepares working health- care professionals to become top leaders. This highly competitive, online learning program uses the latest internet technology to connect distinguished faculty members and students in an unparalleled educational environment.

Doctor of Philosophy
The department of Public Policy offers the Ph.d. degree to students who aim to contribute new knowledge and solve major domestic and
global challenges or policy problems. Graduates of the program are prepared to conduct sophisticated policy research that provides useful information to decision makers and to advance the bodies of knowledge about public policy making in general and about their specific policy field. doctoral graduates of the department of Public Policy hold academic positions in major universities, research positions in policy research organizations, and senior policy staff positions in government agencies and other policy development organizations.
The Ph.d. in public policy combines core foundations in theory, empirical and normative analysis, political institutions and the policy-making process, and research methods with a policy field area that is chosen and developed by the student with the approval of an individualized doctoral program committee. The curriculum is designed to help each doctoral student develop and use appropriate analytical approaches to solve problems in public policy areas such as education, innovation and entrepreneurship, labor markets, health and social policy, immigration, environment, national security, international development and global health and environment.
Admission
students are admitted to the doctoral program in public policy from diverse backgrounds in both academic preparation and experience,
and such diversity is welcomed. in preparation for doctoral study, applicants should have completed preparatory courses in intermediate microeconomics, basic statistics, and quantitative analysis (including calculus); a master’s degree and some public policy-related work experience are desirable. All entering students are also required to take a course in basic quantitative techniques in economics during the August prior to the beginning of their first semester.
Applications for admission in the fall semester must be received no later than the posted deadlines for the following fall semester. However, applications must be received by the december deadline to receive full consideration for Graduate school competitive awards. All prospective students must take the Graduate record examination (Gre), and applicants from non-english-speaking countries who do not have a degree from a U.s. institution must also submit results of the test
of english as a foreign language (toefl). factors considered in
the application review include the academic transcript, Gre scores, class rank, references, statements of interest, fit with faculty research expertise, and professional experience.
Applicants are encouraged to visit the campus for a personal interview with the faculty and to meet current students in the program.
Degree Requirements
Core courses. once enrolled, each student completes a set of doctoral- level core courses in applications of interdisciplinary social science theory to public policy issues, as well as research design, appropriate research methods, including econometrics, and a specialization in a particular subject area of public policy. doctoral students are required to complete 47 hours of course work, including 29 hours in core courses common
to all students and 18 hours in a self-defined policy specialization field. Core courses include PlCy 700, 710, 716, 717, 780, 788, 789, 801, 810, 881, and 882. students who have successfully completed graduate courses elsewhere that approximate these required courses may petition to have up to nine such hours counted toward the Ph.d. in public policy. Courses proposed for transfer must be approved as part of the student’s program within the department, and material from those courses may be included as part of the comprehensive doctoral examinations. students normally spend two years in full-time course work, and somewhat longer if they enter the program without key prerequisite courses or a master’s degree in a related field. A dissertation is required.

￼Policy field. each student designs an individual course of study for a policy field. The 18-credit-hour requirement gives students rigorous training in the theory, methods, and subject matter within a substantive policy field. The field area course of study must include both doctoral- level understanding of the subject matter of the policy area and at least six hours of research methods, in addition to the econometrics sequence (881 and 882) and research design course (801) required for the core. students take no less than nine credit hours of courses related to the theory and subject matter of their policy field; up to six hours of credits may be taken as independent studies. The remaining six hours of the required policy field credits are normally completed as PlCy 992 and 994 during masters and dissertation research. The student’s additional research methods course should provide the student with the ability
to design and carry out dissertation research and to continue making scholarly contributions in his or her chosen field. each student is assisted by an individualized program committee in identifying courses, independent readings, and other sources of information to acquire both the substantive knowledge and the quantitative and other analytical skills appropriate for the student’s policy field specialization.
Public Policy Math Camp (PLCY 700). The department requires that incoming Ph.d. students participate in a two-week math and statistics camp during the beginning of August prior to their first year of study. This is a three-credit course.
Public Policy Research Seminar (PLCY 810). The department offers a weekly seminar course in which faculty, public policy scholars, government officials, and public policy doctoral students present their research and share their perspectives on policy issues. each student is expected to enroll in this one-credit seminar for two semesters.
Graduate Minor
doctoral and master’s students not enrolled in the department of Public Policy may elect to minor in public policy. requirements for the minor include 15 hours of approved course work in public policy for doctoral students, or 9 credits for master’s students, approved by the department of Public Policy and the student’s major department (These may not include double-counting of courses required for the student’s major degree).
Research and Faculty Expertise
students can tap the considerable resources of the UnC community to support a wide range of policy interests. The department of Public Policy has developed particular strengths in five broad areas of policy research and application:
Education and Child Policy. The department has a strong and
highly productive cluster of faculty research expertise in the area of education policy, including evaluation of federal and state policies for K–12 education, pre-kindergarten education, and higher education.
in addition, the faculty is interested in questions concerning the returns to education and the impacts of external events on educational achievement and attainment. The state of north Carolina provides
an excellent laboratory for studying education policy, and our faculty and students also have opportunities for interaction with UnC’s frank Porter Graham Child development institute, the James b. Hunt Jr. institute for educational leadership and Policy, and other nearby educational research and policymaking organizations. (related faculty: Gitterman, Handa, Hemelt, lauen, Perreira)
Environmental Policy (Domestic and International). recent faculty and doctoral student research includes particular emphasis on climate change, energy policy, environment and human welfare, and environmental and natural resource management policies in state, national and developing country contexts, and on environmental management policies and procedures in business supply chains. The
department of Public Policy cooperates in environmental research and public service activities as well as teaching with the Curriculum for environment and ecology, the UnC institute for the environment, the department of environmental sciences and engineering, the department of City and regional Planning, the UnC environmental finance Center, the Center for sustainable enterprise in the Kenan– flagler business school, and numerous other academic units with environmental interests. Chapel Hill and the research triangle area are two of the premier regions in the world for environmental research and policy, including multiple ePA laboratories, the national institute for environmental Health sciences, research triangle institute, and active collaboration with state agencies as well as complementary strengths at duke University and north Carolina state University (related faculty: Andrews, Jagger, MacKay).
Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Economic Development, and Science and Technology Policy. The department’s faculty includes particular research expertise in the regional clustering of scientific knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurship, the commercialization of academic research, and factors that promote technological change and economic growth. The research triangle region is itself internationally recognized as a premier example of knowledge-based economic development. The department also works closely with other key units
on campus with strengths in economic development, innovation and entrepreneurship, and science and technology policy, including the frank Hawkins Kenan institute of Private enterprise, the departments of City and regional Planning, economics, and sociology, and the schools of business, Government, law, and Public Health. students have ample opportunities to work with economic development and science and technology organizations located in the region, including the research triangle institute, southern Growth Policies board, the rural economic development Center, the north Carolina board of science and technology, and others. (related faculty: feldman; Gitterman)
Social Policy, Including Social Safety Net Policies and Low-Income Communities. The department’s faculty includes particular research expertise on U.s. social safety-net policies for low-income families and retirees, needs and outcomes for immigrant youth and their families, and innovative policy incentives such as contingent cash transfer incentives in developing countries. This area of research also includes collaborative activities with the Carolina Population Center, the UnC Center for Community Capitalism, the institute on Aging, and the Jordan institute of family Policy in the school of social work. (related faculty: Gitterman, Handa, Hemelt, Moulton, Perreira, scott)
Health Policy. faculty in Public Policy study issues relating to mental health and substance abuse, Aids, environmental health, health insurance and managed care, and health issues in developing countries, all with a focus on achieving better health outcomes, health as a human right, and on the economic and institutional basis of effective policies. Public Policy faculty and doctoral students also collaborate with considerable expertise and resources in the school of Public Health,
the department of social Medicine, the Carolina Population Center, the Cecil sheps Center for Health services research, neighboring universities, contract research organizations, and international donor organizations. (related faculty: durrance, Gitterman, Handa, MacKay, Meier, Perreira)
Global Policy Issues. Many of our faculty members study issues whose causes and consequences extend across borders. because these issues
do not respect political boundaries, they can be the source of conflict between countries. At the same time, they are often most effectively addressed by policy responses that require international cooperation. Members of our faculty use rigorous social science methods to
￼
examine the effects of foreign policy initiatives, as well as the unique opportunities and challenges that arise in the context of problems
that require cooperation among nations and between nations and nongovernmental organizations. specific areas of expertise include
the impact of international economic integration on labor standards, the utility of military force as a foreign policy instrument, the effects
of foreign aid on national policies and outcomes, how international
law affects public health, and international cooperation to address critical environmental issues. students interested in global policy issues benefit from opportunities for to connect with the triangle institute for security studies, the UnC institute for the environment, the Curriculum in Peace, war, and defense, the UnC Center for Global initiatives, and the Curriculum in Global studies. (related core faculty: Andrews, Gitterman, Handa, Jagger, MacKay, Meier, sullivan)
Financial Assistance
students who apply by the december 15 deadline, who are admitted will automatically be considered for a range of financial support, including Graduate school fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. Many awards grant full tuition privileges and medical insurance coverage, substantially increasing their value to the student. Prospective students are encouraged to contact faculty members whose research is in areas of their potential interest and experience.
Resources

The graduate program in religious studies at the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill deals with religion both as a distinctive human experience and as a mode of culture and history. both orientations define religion as a broad area of human existence, and students are encouraged to explore the tension between those two general approaches. The interests of the department’s faculty express the variety of methodological orientations in such study, and faculty members in other departments of the University offer strong interdisciplinary support.
The Graduate school of the University offers two degrees in religious studies: the master of arts and the doctor of philosophy. The department of religious studies also sponsors the joint duke-UnC Graduate Certificate in Middle east studies. The M.A. program introduces students to the general problems and methods in the study of religion. specific requirements include:
• Thirty hours of course credit, including RELI 700 and one “gateway” graduate seminar
• A written comprehensive examination in the student’s specific field of study
• A thesis of three to six credits and an oral defense of the thesis, and
• Demonstrated competence in a modern foreign research language
The Ph.d. program is primarily intended to prepare students for a career in university and college teaching and research in religious studies. it currently offers specialization in ancient Mediterranean religions, islamic studies, medieval and early modern studies, religion in the Americas, religion and culture, and religions of Asia.
Ph.d. students should expect to take at least 18 hours of course work beyond the M.A. level. other requirements in the doctoral program include:
• Completion of requirements specific to one of the specialty fields of study noted above
• A set of written and oral doctoral examinations specific to the student’s field of study
￼￼
• Demonstrated reading competence in a second modern foreign research language, and
• A doctoral dissertation and an oral defense of the dissertation
Additional information about the graduate program in religious studies is available at the department’s web site: religion.unc.edu.

The M.S.W. Program
students complete the foundation curriculum of 32 credit hours of content in the areas of human behavior and the social environment, institutionalized discrimination, social work practice, social policy,and research. in the advanced curriculum, students choose among three concentration areas for an additional 30 academic credit hours, including (1) the community, management and policy practice concentration area, (2) the direct practice concentration area, and (3) the self-directed concentration area.
The community, management and policy practice concentration prepares students for advanced work in social work administration, management, community and policy practice. The direct practice concentration prepares students for advanced practice with individuals, families, and groups. The self-directed concentration allows students who have specific career goals requiring an equal mix of direct and community or management skills to craft a blended concentration, combining direct and community, management and policy practice courses to gain the skills needed for their particular professional goals.
in both the Msw foundation and advanced curriculum, students
also enroll in field education in addition to their classroom-based coursework. in field education, Msw students are placed in more
than 250 government, nonprofit, and other human services agencies throughout north Carolina each semester of their studies. Through these field placements, students receive hands-on experience working in various areas, such as anti-poverty programs, child welfare, community and program development, family violence, geriatrics, healthcare, mental health, and substance abuse.
students develop coherent and cohesive plans of study to meet their Msw degree requirements in consultation with faculty advisors. working with their advisors, students select courses to meet their individual professional and educational goals while also meeting the academic requirements of their concentration. in addition, students can explore content outside of their concentration, and use elective credits to pursue learning goals related to diverse areas of interest.
Admission into the Msw program is based on an evaluation of the applicant’s transcripts, references, written statement of interest in the field, Graduate record examination (Gre) scores, prior experience,
￼

The division of speech and Hearing sciences in the school of Medicine’s department of Allied Health sciences provides academic and professional education for speech-language pathologists and audiologists. Programs of study are available at the master’s and doctoral levels in speech language pathology. both clinical (Au.d.)
and research (Ph.d.) doctoral degrees are offered. The study of speech and hearing requires knowledge in both normal and abnormal speech, hearing, and language. The speech and hearing sciences curriculum provides a multifaceted learning environment including classroom, laboratory, and clinical experiences. Three major tracks of study are possible within the curriculum: audiology, speech-language pathology, and speech and hearing sciences. There are three academic degree programs: 1) a master’s degree (M.s.) for entry-level clinical practice
of speech-language pathology, 2) a professional doctorate (Au.d.) for entry-level clinical practice in audiology, and 3) a Ph.d. in speech and hearing sciences, for individuals with a background in speech-language pathology or audiology who desire a research degree. All the programs are interdisciplinary, involving clinical and research activities with other University departments and institutions, in addition to the division of speech and Hearing sciences.
The entrance, academic, and residence requirements for the M.s. and Ph.d. degrees correspond to those of The Graduate school. Applicants to the Au.d. program follow the guidelines established by the school of Medicine for that degree program. All students enrolled in professional tracks (M.s. and Au.d.) are prepared to meet licensure and certification requirements necessary for the practice of speech-language pathology or audiology. More complete information describing the graduate program can be obtained on the web at www.med.unc.edu/ahs/sphs.

Graduate Degrees in Statistics and Operations Research
The department offers the master of science (M.s.) and doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.) in statistics and operations research (stor). each degree encompasses three programs: statistics (stAt), operations research (or), and interdisciplinary statistics and operations research (instore).
The Ph.d. degree in stor is designed for students planning a career in teaching or research. This degree requires at least three (but usually four
to five) years of full-time graduate study, predicated upon substantial undergraduate mathematical preparation. research is a central component in the work of doctoral candidates. research training consists of required core course work as well as electives that are designed to bring students
up to date in their research field, and intensive one-on-one work with a faculty member on a specific dissertation topic. doctoral students who want to pursue academic careers are provided with ample opportunities to teach introductory undergraduate courses, and they are given extensive training to develop their instructional skills. doctoral students may also participate in paid internships with local industrial employers to gain experience in a business environment. Their professional skills are further enhanced by work on real-world projects with clients in the department’s consulting courses. several courses provide opportunities for students to give technical presentations and refine their communication skills.
The M.s. degree in stor prepares students for jobs in industry and government, and for further graduate study. The philosophy of the M.s. degree is to train students in the basic theory and applications of statistics and/or operations research. Completion of the M.s. degree typically requires two years of full-time graduate study.
further information on the graduate degree programs can be obtained from the department’s home page on the web at www.stat-or.unc.edu. information about the or, stAt, and instore programs may also be obtained from the admissions chair of the individual programs, Cb# 3260, Hanes Hall, The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, nC 27599.
Application forms for admission and/or financial aid are available through the web site of The Graduate school at gradschool.unc.edu/ admissions. students can indicate on this application form whether they intend to pursue the degree program in or, stAt, or instore. Applicants are required to submit scores for both the Aptitude and Advanced Mathematics portions of the Graduate record examination (Gre) in support of their application, and a supplementary sheet providing brief course descriptions (including textbook title where applicable) of previous undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics, probability, and statistics.
Graduate Program in Operations Research
operations research is concerned with the process of decision-making for the purpose of optimal resource allocation. The spectrum of related activities includes basic research in optimization theory, development of deterministic and stochastic mathematical models as aids for decision-making and application of these models to real world problems. The principal steps in modeling consist of analyzing relationships that determine the probable future consequences of decision choices, and then devising appropriate measures of effectiveness in order to evaluate the relative merits of alternative actions. during the past 50 years, operations research has developed as a mathematical science whose methods of analysis are regularly employed in many diverse industries and governmental agencies.
The operations research faculty consists of a resident faculty and an interdisciplinary faculty, with programs of study that offer considerable opportunity for the pursuit of individual student interests. specialization is possible in deterministic optimization theory (such as nonlinear and integer programming), in stochastic processes and applied probability (such as queueing theory and simulation) or in an approved area of application (such as management science). The M.s. program is intended for the student who is preparing for a career in industry, government,
or consulting. The Ph.d. program emphasizes theoretical depth and is tailored primarily for the student who is preparing for a career in teaching and/or research. each program includes study of the mathematical foundations of operations research. in either case, the specific program
of study for each student is determined to a large extent on an individual basis through consultations with a faculty advisor to obtain a balance between application and theory. Although it is possible for the well- prepared student to complete the M.s. requirements in three semesters,
it more typically requires four semesters. The Ph.d. program, including the dissertation, generally requires four or five years beyond the bachelor’s degree. The department offers a minor for Ph.d. students in other departments. The department also offers a course sequence that enables qualified UnC–Chapel Hill undergraduates in the mathematical decision sciences b.s. degree program to fulfill the requirements for the M.s. degree in operations research in one additional academic year (beyond the four years required for the undergraduate degree).
Requirements for Admission to Graduate Study
in Operations Research
Applicants must have demonstrated a high level of scholastic
ability in their undergraduate studies and must satisfy the entrance requirements of The Graduate school. no restrictions are placed on the undergraduate major for admission to the program. However, to be prepared adequately for study in operations research, an applicant should have a good mathematical background, including courses in advanced calculus, linear or matrix algebra, probability and statistics, and the knowledge of a computer language. A student admitted with a deficiency in one or more of these topics must make up for it at the beginning of her or his graduate work. if the deficiency is not severe, this can be accomplished without interrupting the normal program.
Degree Requirements for Operations Research
Candidates for degrees in operations research must meet the general requirements of The Graduate school. Course selections for a degree in operations research are taken from the department’s offerings and from the regular offerings of related departments including biostatistics, City and regional Planning, Computer science, epidemiology, economics, Health Policy and Management, information and library science, Mathematics, Psychology, the Kenan–flagler business school, and the fuqua school of business at duke University.

￼
Graduate Program in Statistics
The statistics program offers graduate training leading to the master of science (M.s.) and doctor of philosophy (Ph.d.) degrees. The M.s. degree may be included in the doctoral program.
M.S. Program
The statistics M.s. program provides students with rigorous training in one or more areas of statistics and probability. The program is flexible enough to accommodate students with a variety of backgrounds and a variety of career interests.
The M.s. degree provides a valuable complement to a number of Ph.d. programs in the sciences and social sciences, and enhances the credentials of students in these programs seeking academic or industrial jobs. over the years, students have completed the statistics M.s. degree concurrently with a Ph.d. in other areas such as economics, sociology, psychology, mathematics, and physics.
The statistics M.s. degree requires 30 credit hours of course work
and the completion of a master’s project. students can choose from a wide variety of courses, including a limited number from outside the department. Upon approval of The Graduate school, at most six credit hours may be transferred from another accredited institution, or from within UnC–Chapel Hill for courses taken before admission to the M.s. program.
Ph.D. Program
The Ph.d. program in statistics provides students with a broad-based course of study in applied statistics, theoretical statistics and probability, as well as numerous advanced topic courses. The breadth and depth of the program has served graduates well in their subsequent careers in academia, industry, and government. doctoral students pursue a wide range of dissertation research topics ranging from applied statistics to theoretical probability. Many students are involved in interdisciplinary research that puts them in regular contact with faculty and students from other disciplines.
Basic Requirements for the Statistics Ph.D.
The Ph.d. degree requires at least 45 semester hours of graduate course work and the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation. to meet the course requirements, students typically take 15 three-credit courses. Most courses are selected from among those offered by the statistics program, but approved courses from outside the program can also be counted toward the 45-credit minimum.
More detailed information about the statistics program is available on the department’s home page (listed above). specific inquiries should be addressed to the director of Graduate Admissions, statistics Program, Cb# 3260, The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, nC 27599-3260.
Statistics Courses for Students from Other Disciplines
A number of stor courses in probability and statistics are of potential interest to students in other disciplines. At the advanced undergraduate/ beginning graduate level, stor 455 and 456 provide an introduction to applied statistics, including regression, analysis of variance, and time series. stor 435 and 555 provide introductions to probability theory and mathematical statistics, respectively, at a post-calculus level.
The three graduate course sequences—(664, 665), (654, 655), and (634, 635)—provide comprehensive introductions to modern applied statistics, theoretical statistics, and probability theory, respectively, at a more mathematical level. in each case it is possible to take only the first course in the sequence. Concerning mathematical prerequisites, 664 and 665 require a background in linear algebra and matrix theory, while the remaining courses require a solid background in real-analysis.
INSTORE Program
A Ph.d. and M.s. program entitled interdisciplinary statistics and operations research (instore) was established in the fall semester
of 2007. The instore program is suitable for students pursuing an interdisciplinary research agenda who want to combine elements from the traditional statistics and operations research programs, or who
want to develop significant expertise in the applications of statistics
and operations research to some outside area such as genetics, finance, social science, or environmental science. The instore program allows flexibility for adaptively combining statistics, operations research, and external fields of application. However, there are specific tracks that contain suggested sequences of courses allowing students to focus on certain areas of study. for example, there is a track in applied statistics and optimization, a track in computational finance, and a track in business analytics; further tracks are planned in econometrics and in bioinformatics. A mechanism also exists for students to propose their own track (subject to approval by the department’s faculty). for detailed descriptions of the content and requirements of the instore program go to stat-or.unc.edu/programs and click on “interdisciplinary statistics and operations research.”

The Curriculum
The Curriculum in toxicology administers a degree program
leading to the award of the Ph.d. in toxicology. The curriculum is
an interdisciplinary program, and its faculty is drawn from various administrative units of the schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public Health. The training faculty also includes scientists at government laboratories on campus or in the research triangle Park (e.g., ePA, nieHs). The research interests of the faculty include most areas of toxicology, with particular emphasis on understanding the links between the environment and health risks, the mode of action of toxicants
and disease pathogenesis and how emerging knowledge could be translated into prevention strategies, new therapeutic interventions,
and an improved scientific basis for risk assessment. The main areas
of research concentration are molecular carcinogenesis, mechanistic toxicology, neurotoxicology, cardiopulmonary toxicology, hepatic toxicology, computational toxicology, developmental toxicology, immunotoxicology, drug and xenobiotic metabolism, and ethanol toxicology. Multidisciplinary efforts are directed at environmental toxicology, systems biology, animal models of human diseases, translational research, and biomarkers. The faculty generally does not conduct research in the areas of aquatic toxicology, forensic toxicology, the ecological aspects of toxicology, or studies in invertebrate systems. The research activities of the Curriculum in toxicology are conducted
in the laboratory facilities assigned to each faculty member by a participating administrative unit.
Applications
students with interest in the Ph.d. degree in toxicology must apply
for Graduate school admission through the biological and biomedical sciences Program. Applications are considered from students who have received or expect to receive a b.s./b.A. or an M.s. degree in a scientific discipline. A desirable background for predoctoral studies in toxicology includes courses in biological sciences (including histology and animal physiology), in chemistry (including analytical and organic), and in mathematics through calculus, although all of these are not absolutely essential. A strong course in general biochemistry accelerates the student’s progress. Applicants are evaluated on the basis of undergraduate (and graduate) academic performance, Graduate record examination (Gre)
toXiColoGy 373
￼￼
374 www.UnC.edU/GrAdreCord
￼scores, and letters of recommendation. students are accepted on the basis of their achievement and potential. Prior research experience is strongly considered in the assessment of qualifications for admission.
Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
The selection of graduate courses is influenced by the student’s prior academic background. The academic courses that are considered appropriate for graduate training in toxicology include biochemistry, biostatistics, pathology, pharmacology, toxicology, and two elective courses in the specific areas of the doctoral research. in addition, each predoctoral student is expected to participate in other training activities—i.e., student- centered seminars and scientific meetings—while developing the doctoral dissertation project. Attendance and participation in the Curriculum in toxicology seminar series is required during the entire training period.
A major requirement for the Ph.d. degree is a doctoral dissertation based on the development of the student’s research project. written and oral examinations are required in the fields of general toxicology and the student’s research concentration.
Financial Aid
The curriculum seeks to fund predoctoral students each year. All applicants are considered for financial aid awards.

Appendix
Alcoholic Beverages
Possession and use of alcoholic beverages is substantially regulated
by federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. within this legal framework, the University’s Policy on student Possession and Consumption of Alcoholic beverages in facilities of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill sets out the conditions under which alcoholic beverages may be used on University property.
According to north Carolina law
• Generally persons 21 or older may purchase or consume alcoholic beverages and may possess alcoholic beverages at their homes or temporary residences.
• It is against the law for any person under 21 to purchase or possess any alcoholic beverage.
• It is against the law for anyone to sell or give any alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 or to aid or abet such a person in selling, purchasing, or possessing any alcoholic beverage.
• No alcoholic beverages may be sold by any person, organization, or corporation on a college campus except as permitted by n.C. Gen. stat. § 18b-1006 (a).
According to Chapel Hill ordinance, it is against the law for anyone to possess any open container of alcohol on streets, sidewalks, alleys, or any other property owned or controlled by the town of Chapel Hill.
in addition to following the law, the University’s Policy on student Possession and Consumption of Alcoholic beverages in facilities of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill sets out special rules about alcohol for students and student organizations. The office of the dean of students will provide copies of the policy and assistance in understanding its full implications. The text of the policy can be accessed on the web at policies.unc.edu/policy-category/university.
Under the policy
• Alcohol may not be served, consumed, or sold in any University facility or open space except as provided in the University’s Guidelines for serving Alcohol at University-sponsored events. The guidelines are available on the web at policies.unc.edu/policy-category/university.
• Common source containers of alcohol (e.g., kegs) are not permitted on campus.
• Students and their guests age 21 and older may possess and consume alcoholic beverages in individual campus residence hall rooms or apartments on campus, but not in the common areas of a campus residence hall.
• No student activity fees or other University-collected fees may be used to purchase alcohol.
• No other funds of an officially recognized student group deposited or administered through the student Activities fund office may be used to purchase alcohol.
• Student groups are not prohibited from having events off campus at which individual group members age 21 or older bring or buy their own alcoholic beverages.
students who violate the policy face mandatory alcohol education, housing sanctions (for violations arising in University housing), and sanctions, including written reprimand, restitution, counseling/referral, and/or educational or community service activities. student groups who violate the policy face sanctions of written reprimand, restitution, mandatory educational programs or community service, and/or loss
of University recognition. behavior that violates the Code of student Conduct, state, or federal laws may also be referred to the office of student Conduct, the emergency evaluation and Action Committee, and/or state and federal authorities.
Emergency Disciplinary Action
in order to protect University property or members of the University community or to prevent disruption of the academic process, occasionally the University must take emergency action to separate a student from the University or such other intermediate action as may
be warranted. The Chancellor has, therefore, created the emergency evaluation and Action Committee. with respect to disciplinary matters, the committee acts only when no other administrative solution, including action by the student Judicial system, is in its judgment adequate to deal effectively with the situation.
students whose cases may require action by the committee fall into five categories:
• Applicants for admission or readmission to the University who have been convicted of a crime involving assaultive or felonious behavior, who have a record of violent behavior, or who have a record of academic dishonesty or disciplinary rule violations elsewhere;
• Students whose behavior, on or off campus, is such that their presence in the University, in the judgment of the committee, poses a serious threat of disruption of the academic process or a continuing danger to other members of the University community, or University property;
• Students or applicants who have been arrested and charged with a serious crime of a violent or dangerous nature, or a serious crime that involved placing another person in fear of imminent physical injury or danger, where, in the judgment of the committee, if the students are found guilty, their presence in the University would pose a serious threat of disruption of the academic process or a continuing danger to other members of the University community, or University property;
• Students, charged by the University with a violation of policies concerning illegal drugs, whose continued presence within the University community would, if the charges are true, constitute a clear and immediate danger to the health or welfare of other members of the University community;
• Students whose behavior on or off campus is such that, in the judgment of the committee, they pose a danger to themselves.
full information on the committee and its procedures is available from the division of student Affairs through the office of the dean of students. The text of the committee’s policy and procedures is on the web at policy.sites.unc.edu/files/2013/04/eeAC.pdf

￼Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act
information compiled under the federal equity in Athletics disclosure Act is available on request from the office of the director of Athletics.
Expulsion
A student who has been expelled from an institution in the University of north Carolina system may not be admitted to another UnC system school unless the institution that originally expelled the student rescinds that expulsion.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
As a general rule, under the federal family educational rights and Privacy Act (ferPA), personally identifiable information may not be released from a student’s education records without his or her prior written consent. exceptions to this rule are set out in the ferPA regulations
and the ferPA policy of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill. A few of the exceptions are listed below; others may be found in the University’s ferPA policy and accompanying federal regulations.
The University will disclose personally identifiable information from
a student’s education records to officials of another institution in
which the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student’s enrollment or transfer. The University will also disclose personally identifiable information from a student’s education records to officials of another institution in which a currently enrolled UnC–Chapel Hill student is contemporaneously enrolled. it is the policy of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill to forward education records upon request to officials of other institutions in these situations without notifying the student of such transfer of records.
if the University takes disciplinary action against a student for conduct that posed a significant risk to the safety or well-being of the student, other students, or members of the University community, the University may disclose information about that disciplinary action to officials
of other schools who have been determined to have a legitimate educational interest in the student’s behavior. it is the policy of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill to disclose this type of disciplinary information to such officials of other schools without notifying the student that the information has been disclosed.
if the University, pursuant to campus disciplinary procedures, finds that a student has committed a violation of the Honor Code that constitutes a crime of violence or a nonforcible sex offense, the University, upon request, discloses the following information: the student’s name, the rule or policy that was violated, any essential findings supporting the conclusion that the violation was committed, the disciplinary sanction imposed, the date the sanction was imposed, and the duration of the sanction. The University will release information from a student’s education records to school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the information. The term “school official” includes, but is not limited to, teachers; officials; employees (including employees of the UnC–Chapel Hill department of Public safety); contractors of UnC–Chapel Hill to whom the University has outsourced institutional services or functions (for example, the national student Clearinghouse, blackboard, entities providing practical or clinical training for students, and other similar or dissimilar contractors); UnC–Chapel Hill students who are functioning in an official University capacity (for example, members of the Honor Court); and employees of the General Administration of the University of north Carolina system. disclosures may only be made to these individuals and entities if they have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. They are deemed to have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information if it is in the educational interest of the student in question for the individuals
and entities to have the information, or if it is necessary or desirable for them to obtain the information in order to carry out their official duties or their contractual obligations to the University and/or to implement the policies of the University of north Carolina.
The University makes public certain information that has been designated as “directory information” unless the student has notified the office of the University registrar to restrict the release of this information. The University considers the following to be “directory information”: the student’s name; address (local and grade/billing addresses); student e-mail address; telephone listing (local and grade/ billing telephone numbers); date and place of birth; county, state, and/or United states territory from which the student entered the University; major field of study; class (first year, senior, etc.); enrollment status (full-time, half-time, or part-time); Person id number (Pid); anticipated graduation date; participation in officially recognized activities and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; dates of attendance; degrees and awards received; and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. The University also publishes the Campus directory annually and maintains an online directory that includes faculty, staff, and students. some professional and graduate student groups publish directories of students in their departments or schools.
students who do not want any of their directory information to be made public must come in person to the records area of the office
of the University registrar (suite 3100, sAsb north) and fill out a requesting ferPA Privacy flag on student’s record, non-disclosure of information form. students completing this form will receive counseling about the effects of placing a ferPA privacy flag on their records. students who are not within commuting distance of the campus may contact the records area at (919) 962-0495 for further instructions.
students who choose this option will not be able to receive any information about their records by telephone. instead, they must come in person and show a photo id, or send a written request acknowledging that they have placed a restriction on their record but require specific information.
once set, a ferPA privacy flag will remain on a student’s record until the student removes it. to remove a ferPA privacy flag, the student must come in person to the registration area of the office of the University registrar (suite 3100, sAsb north) and fill out a requesting removal of a Previously set ferPA Privacy flag from a student’s record, remove Previously set restrictions on release of information form. students who are not within commuting distance of the campus may contact the registration area at (919) 962-9851 for further instructions.
students who wish to block certain information from the directory but do not wish to place a ferPA privacy flag on their records may do this through the portal my.unc.edu in the “Updating Personal information” section. Checking the “Public” box next to an address or phone number causes that item to be included in the directory. removing
the checkmark from the “Public” box causes the item not to be included in the directory. students who have questions about restricting information from the directory may contact the registration area at (919) 962-9851.
in order to assure that new students have a meaningful opportunity to request that their directory information not be made public, it is the policy of the University that it will not release directory information about entering undergraduate students until after the last day for late registration for the fall semester.
receipt of an approved master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation in
￼
The Graduate school is tantamount to publication, and the thesis or dissertation will be available to the public. Honors theses are also made available to the public through the University library. other student papers may be put in campus libraries or otherwise made public in accordance with individual course or program requirements.
ferPA also gives a student the right to inspect his or her education records and to request amendment of those records if they are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights. to inspect his or her education records, a student must file a written request with the individual who has custody of the records that the student wishes to inspect. to request amendment of his or her records, a student first discusses the matter informally with the records custodian, and if the custodian does not agree to amend the records, he or she will inform the student of applicable appeal rights. enrolled students may file an appeal with the student Grievance Committee. students also have the right to file a complaint with the United states department of education alleging that the University has not complied with ferPA.
Questions about ferPA should be addressed to the office of University Counsel (Cb# 9105). The University’s ferPA policy and the text of the federal ferPA regulations are available on the web at policy.sites.unc. edu/files/2013/05/ferPA.pdf.

Policy on Illegal Drugs
Introduction
The board of trustees of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill, in conformity with the direction of the board of Governors of
the University of north Carolina, hereby adopts this Policy on illegal drugs, effective August 24, 1988. it is applicable to all students, faculty members, administrators, and other employees.
Education, Counseling, and Rehabilitation
A. The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill has established and maintains a program of education designed to help all members of the University community avoid involvement with illegal drugs. This educational program emphasizes these subjects:
• The incompatibility of the use or sale of illegal drugs with the goals of the University;
• The legal consequences of involvement with illegal drugs;
• The medical implications of the use of illegal drugs; and
• The ways in which illegal drugs jeopardize an individual’s present accomplishments and future opportunities.
b. The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill provides information about drug counseling and rehabilitation services available to members of the University community through campus- based programs and through community-based organizations. Persons who voluntarily avail themselves of University services
are hereby assured that applicable professional standards of confidentiality will be observed.
Enforcement and Penalties
A. The University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill shall take all actions necessary, consistent with state and federal law and applicable University policy, to eliminate illegal drugs from the University community. The University’s Policy on illegal drugs is publicized
in catalogs and other materials prepared for all enrolled and prospective students and in materials distributed to faculty members, administrators, and other employees.
b. students, faculty members, administrators, and other employees
are responsible, as citizens, for knowing about and complying
with the provisions of north Carolina law that make it a crime
to possess, sell, deliver, or manufacture those drugs designated collectively as controlled substances in Article 5 of Chapter 90 of the north Carolina General statutes. Any member of the University community who violates that law is subject both to prosecution and punishment by the civil authorities and to disciplinary proceedings by the University. it is not “double jeopardy” for both the civil authorities and the University to proceed against and punish a person for the same specified conduct. The University will initiate its own disciplinary proceeding against a student, faculty member, administrator, or other employee when the alleged conduct is deemed to affect the interests of the University.
C. Penalties will be imposed by the University in accordance with procedural safeguards applicable to disciplinary actions against students, faculty members, administrators, and other employees,
as required by section 3 of the trustee Policies and regulations Governing Academic tenure in the University of north Carolina
at Chapel Hill; by section iii. d. of the employment Policies for ePA non-faculty employees of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill; by regulations of the state Personnel Commission, and the disciplinary Procedure of the staff Personnel Administration Guides (Human resources Manual for sPA employees); by the instrument of student Judicial Governance; and by all other applicable provisions of the policies and procedures of the University of north Carolina at Chapel Hill.
d. The penalties to be imposed by the University may range from written warnings with probationary status to expulsions from enrollment and discharges from employment. However, the following minimum penalties shall be imposed for the particular offenses described.
Trafficking in Illegal Drugs
a. for the illegal manufacture, sale, or delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver, of any controlled substance identified in schedule i, north Carolina General statutes 90–89, or schedule ii, north Carolina General statutes 90–90 (including, but not limited to, heroin, mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide, opium, cocaine, amphetamine, methaqualine), any student shall be expelled and any faculty member, administrator, or other employee shall be discharged.
b. for a first offense involving the illegal manufacture, sale, or delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, or

￼deliver, of any controlled substance identified in schedules iii through vi, north Carolina General statutes 90–91 through 90–94, (including, but not limited to, marijuana, anabolic steroids, pentobarbital, codeine), the minimum penalty shall be suspension from enrollment or from employment for a period of at least one semester or its equivalent. (employees subject to the state Personnel Act are governed by regulations of the state Personnel Commission. because the minimum penalty specified in this section and required by the board
of Governors exceeds the maximum period of suspension without pay that is permitted by state Personnel Commission regulations, the penalty for a first offense for employees subject to the state Personnel Act is discharge.) for a second offense, any student shall be expelled and any faculty member, administrator, or other employee shall be discharged.
Illegal Possession of Drugs
a. for a first offense involving the illegal possession of any controlled substance identified in schedule i, north Carolina General statutes 90–89, or schedule ii, north Carolina General statutes 90–90, the minimum penalty shall be suspension from enrollment or from employment for a period of at least one semester or its equivalent. (employees subject to the state Personnel Act are governed by regulations of the state Personnel Commission. because the minimum penalty specified in this section and required by the board
of Governors exceeds the maximum period of suspension without pay that is permitted by state Personnel Commission regulations, the penalty for a first offense for employees subject to the state Personnel Act is discharge.)
b. for a first offense involving the illegal possession of any controlled substance identified in schedules iii through vi, north Carolina General statutes 90–91 through 90–94,
the minimum penalty shall be probation, for a period to be determined on a case-by-case basis. A person on probation must agree to participate in a drug education and counseling program, consent to regular drug testing, and accept such other conditions and restrictions, including a program of community service, as the Chancellor or the Chancellor’s designee deems appropriate. refusal or failure to abide
by the terms of probation shall result in suspension from enrollment or from employment for any unexpired balance
of the prescribed period of probation. (if this balance for an employee subject to the state Personnel Act exceeds one week, that employee shall be discharged.)
c. for second or other subsequent offenses involving the illegal possession of controlled substances, progressively more severe penalties shall be imposed, including expulsion of students and discharge of faculty members, administrators, or other employees.
e. suspension Pending final disposition. when a student, faculty member, administrator, or other employee has been charged by
the University with a violation of policies concerning illegal drugs,
he or she may be suspended from enrollment or employment
before initiation or completion of regular disciplinary proceedings
if, assuming the truth of the charges, the Chancellor, or in the Chancellor’s absence, the Chancellor’s designee, concludes that the person’s continued presence within the University Community would constitute a clear and immediate danger to the health or welfare of other members of the University community; provided, that if such a suspension is imposed, an appropriate hearing of the charges against the suspended person shall be held as promptly as possible thereafter.
Implementation and Reporting
Annually, the Chancellor shall submit to the board of trustees a report on campus activities related to illegal drugs for the preceding year. The report shall include, as a minimum, the following information:
1) A listing of the major educational activities conducted during the year
2) A report on any illegal drug-related incidents, including any sanctions imposed
3) An assessment by the Chancellor of the effectiveness of the campus program
4) Any proposed changes in the Policy on illegal drugs
A copy of the report shall be provided to the President, who shall confer with the Chancellor about the effectiveness of campus programs.
Immunization Requirement
effective July 1, 1986, north Carolina state law requires that no person shall attend a college or university in north Carolina unless a certificate of immunization indicating that the person has received the immunizations required by the law is presented to the college or university on or before the first day of matriculation.
if a student’s UnC–Chapel Hill Medical History form containing the certificate of immunization is not in the possession of the UnC–Chapel Hill Campus Health service 10 days prior to the registration date, the University shall present a notice of deficiency to the student in question. He or she shall have 30 calendar days from the first day of attendance
to obtain the required immunizations. Those persons who have not complied with the immunization requirements by the end of 30 calendar days will be administratively withdrawn from the University.
Military Tuition Benefit
The information in this section comes from two sources: 1) north Carolina General statutes, sect. 116–143.3; and 2) A Manual to
Assist the Public Higher Education Institutions of North Carolina in the Matter of State Residence (the Manual). Please refer to the Manual at www.northcarolina.edu/legal/residence/committee/manual/residence_ Manual_Aug_2010.pdf for specific policy information regarding the military tuition benefit.
Certain members of the Armed services and their dependent relatives who are not residents for tuition purposes may become eligible to be charged the in-state tuition rate under north Carolina General statutes section 116–143.3, the military tuition benefit provision. Any person seeking the military tuition benefit must qualify for admission to UnC– Chapel Hill and must file an application for the benefit with his or her admissions office. The burden of proving eligibility for the military tuition benefit lies with the applicant. because of the time involved
in securing the necessary affidavits from the appropriate military authorities, prospective applicants for the military tuition benefit are urged to secure application forms from their admissions offices and begin the application process several weeks before the first day of classes of the term for which they seek the benefit. The application deadlines are posted on the office of the University registrar’s web site at registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/residency/important-dates.
Eligibility of Members of the Armed Services. to be eligible for this military tuition benefit, the individual must be on active duty and a member of the United states Air force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, navy, north Carolina national Guard, or a reserve component of one of these services and must be abiding in north Carolina incident to active military duty.
￼
Eligibility of Dependent Relatives of Service Members. if the service member meets the conditions set forth above, his or her dependent relatives may be eligible to pay the in-state tuition rate if they share the service member’s north Carolina abode, if they have complied with the requirements of the selective service system (if applicable), and if they qualify as military dependents of the service member.
special exceptions apply to military personnel and their dependents if the military person is reassigned outside of north Carolina or retires in north Carolina. Please consult the Manual at www.northcarolina.edu/ legal/residence/committee/manual/residence_Manual_Aug_2010.pdf for specific policy information.
Appeals of Eligibility Determinations of Admissions Officers. A student appeal of an eligibility determination made by any admissions officer must be in writing and signed by the student and must be filed by the student with that officer within 15 working days after the student receives notice of the eligibility determination. The appeal is transmitted to the residence Appeals board by that officer. The student is notified
of the date set for consideration of the appeal, and, on request by the student, is afforded an opportunity to appear and be heard by the board.
Any student desiring to appeal a determination of the residence Appeals board must give notice in writing of that fact to the chair of the residence Appeals board within 10 days of receipt of the board’s decision. The chair will promptly process the appeal for transmittal to the state residence Committee.
Adjustment of Tuition
if a student withdraws from the University tuition and fees will be prorated according to the withdrawal refund schedule posted under “important dates” on the web at finance.unc.edu/university-controller/student- account-services/student-billing.html. if a student drops the only course he or she is taking, this constitutes a withdrawal from the University.
Residence Status for Tuition Purposes
The information in this section comes from two sources: 1) north Carolina General statutes, sect. 116–143.1, and 2) A Manual to Assist the Public Higher Education Institutions of North Carolina in the Matter of State Residence, adopted by UnC in August 2010.
The following sections summarize important aspects of the residency law. A complete explanation of the statute and the procedures under the statute is contained in A Manual to Assist the Public Higher Education Institutions of North Carolina in the Matter of State Residence (the Manual). The Manual is available online at www.northcarolina.edu/ legal/residence/committee/manual/residence_Manual_Aug_2010.pdf.
every applicant for admission is required to make a statement of his or her length of residence in north Carolina. A person who qualifies as
a resident for tuition purposes under north Carolina law pays a lower rate of tuition than a nonresident. to qualify for in-state tuition, a
legal resident must have been domiciled in north Carolina for at least 12 months immediately prior to the beginning of the term for which classification as a resident for tuition purposes is sought. The student must also establish that his or her presence in the state during such 12-month period was for purposes of maintaining a bona fide domicile rather than for purposes of maintaining a mere temporary residence incident to enrollment in an institution of higher education. “domicile” means one’s permanent home of indefinite duration, as distinguished from a temporary place of abode. domicile is synonymous with legal residence and is established by being physically present in a place with the concurrent intent to make that place a domicile. to determine intent, the University evaluates an individual’s objectively verifiable conduct as an indicator of his or her state of mind.
Procedural Information
General. A student admitted to initial enrollment in an institution
(or permitted to reenroll following an absence that involved a formal withdrawal from enrollment) is classified by the admitting institution either as a resident or as a nonresident for tuition purposes prior to actual matriculation. in the absence of a current and final determination of the student’s residence prior to matriculation, the student is classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes. The institution will thereafter reach a final determination of the student’s residence status. Unless a person supplies enough information to allow the admissions officer to classify him or her as a resident for tuition purposes, the person will be classified a nonresident for tuition purposes. A residence classification once assigned (and confirmed pursuant to any appellate process invoked) may be changed thereafter (with a corresponding change in billing rates) only at the beginning of a term.
Transfer Students. when a student transfers from one north Carolina public institution of higher education to another, he or she is required
to be treated as a new student by the institution to which he or she
is transferring and must be assigned an initial residence classification
for tuition purposes. The residence classification of a student by one institution is not binding on another institution. The north Carolina institutions of higher education will assist each other by supplying residency information and classification records concerning a student to another classifying institution upon request. A student or prospective student who wants the University to consider his or her “resident” classification by another north Carolina public higher education institution must include, with his or her application for resident status, copies of all the information that was before the other institution at the time that institution classified the student a resident for tuition purposes.
Responsibility of Students. Any student who is uncertain about the accuracy of his or her current residence classification for tuition purposes is responsible for securing a ruling by completing an application for resident status and filing it with the admissions officer. The student
who subsequently becomes eligible for a change in classification, whether from out-of-state to in-state or the reverse, is responsible for immediately informing the office of Admissions in writing of his or her new status. failure to give complete and correct information regarding residence constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.
Application Process. A person may apply for resident status by
visiting his or her admissions office or by going online to registrar. unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/Applicationforms/index.
htm. Also available on the web site is the Manual, which sets forth
the requirements of the statute. Applicants for admission who claim eligibility for the in-state tuition rate will complete a brief questionnaire as a part of the online admissions application. if a person has not been living in north Carolina for at least five consecutive years, he or she will be required to complete a more detailed residency application. enrolled students seeking a reclassification from nonresident to resident status are required to complete a residency application.
When to file an application. All applications for resident status must be filed with the proper admissions office during the filing period posted at registrar.unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/importantdates/index.htm. The University follows the application guidelines of the state residence Committee. Applications not received by the applicable deadlines are not accepted for consideration. The deadline to submit an application along with all supporting documentation cannot be later than the 10th business day of the term for which the applicant is seeking residency for tuition. deadlines are posted on the office of the University registrar’s web site at registrar.unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/importantdates/index.htm. The burden of proof remains the responsibility of the applicant. A

￼preponderance of evidence that the applicant is a bona fide domiciliary for tuition purposes may be established by providing tangible evidence to support relevant conduct of legal residence and its duration. This evidence is required at the time of application.
evidence of north Carolina domicile for tuition purposes includes actions that would normally be characteristics and expected of any permanent resident. A variety of evidence is considered when evaluating requests
for in-state tuition status; however, no single factor or combination of factors may be considered conclusive evidence of domicile. Please consult the Manual for illustrative lists of the kinds of information and conduct that may be considered as evidence in determining domicile; including financial dependency and independency.
when a student receives a request for additional documentation as evidence, he or she must supply the requested information no later than 10 business days after receipt of the request. failure to supply the requested information within the specified time limit will result in a continuation of the student’s nonresident classification unless good cause is shown for such failure.
The admissions office may require an applicant for admission to file a residency application or respond to a request for more information more quickly when residence status is a factor in the admissions decision.
for more details about the residency application process and other important information about the resident status for tuition purposes statute, visit registrar.unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/index.htm.
Fraudulent Applications. if a student is classified a resident for tuition purposes after submitting falsified residency information or after knowingly withholding residency information, the student’s application for in-state tuition status is fraudulent. The institution may reexamine any application suspected of being fraudulent and, if warranted, will change the student’s residence status retroactively to the beginning
of the term for which the student originally made the fraudulent application. if this occurs, the student must pay the out-of-state tuition differential for all the enrolled terms intervening between the fraudulent application and its discovery. further, knowing falsification of responses on a resident status application may subject the applicant to disciplinary action, including dismissal from the institution.
Burden of Proof and Statutory Prima Facie Evidence. A person has the burden of establishing facts that justify his or her classification as
a resident for tuition purposes. The balancing of all the evidence must produce a preponderance of evidence supporting the assertion of in- state residence. Under the statute, proof of resident status is controlled initially by one of two evidentiary beginning points which are stated in terms of prima facie evidence.
a. even if the person is an adult, if his or her parents (or court- appointed guardian in the case of some minors) are not legal residents of north Carolina, this is prima facie evidence that the person is not a legal resident of north Carolina unless he or she has lived in this state the five consecutive years prior
to enrolling or reregistering. to overcome this prima facie showing of nonresident, a person must produce evidence that he or she is a north Carolina domiciliary despite the parents’ nonresident status.
b. Conversely, if the person’s parents are domiciliaries of north Carolina under the statute, this fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the person is a domiciliary of north Carolina. This prima facie showing may also be overcome by other evidence to the contrary. if a person has neither living parents nor legal guardian, the prescribed prima facie evidence rule cannot and does not apply.
Erroneous Notices Concerning Classification. if a student who
has been found to be a nonresident for tuition purposes receives an erroneous written notice from an institutional officer identifying the student as a resident for tuition purposes, the student is not responsible for paying the out-of-state tuition differential for any enrolled term beginning before the classifying institution notifies the student that the prior notice was erroneous.
Grace Period. if a student has been properly classified as a north Carolina resident for tuition purposes and, thereafter, his or her state of legal residence changes while he or she is enrolled in a north Carolina public institution of higher education, the statute provides for a grace period during which the student is allowed to pay tuition at the in-state rate despite the fact that the student is no longer a north Carolina legal resident. This grace period extends for a minimum of 12 months from the date of change in legal residence, and if the 12-month period ends during a semester or academic term in which the student is enrolled, the grace period extends also to the end of that semester or academic term.
Reacquisition of Resident Tuition Status. The prescribed 12-month period of legal residence may be shortened if the person seeking to
be classified as a resident for tuition purposes was formerly classified
a north Carolina resident for tuition purposes, abandoned north Carolina domicile, and reestablished north Carolina domicile within 12 months after abandoning it. interested persons should consult their admissions offices for a detailed explanation of the conditions which must be met to qualify under this section.
Appeals. A student appeal of a classification decision made by any admissions officer must be in writing and signed by the student and must be filed by the student with that officer within 15 working days after the student receives notice of the classification decision. The appeal is transmitted to the residence Appeals board by that officer, who
does not vote in that committee on the disposition of such appeal. The student is notified of the date set for consideration of the appeal, and on request of the student, he or she is afforded the opportunity to appear and be heard by the appeals board. Any student desiring to appeal a decision of the residence Appeals board must give notice in writing of that fact (within 10 days of receipt of the board’s decision) to the chair of the residence Appeals board, and the chair promptly processes the appeal for transmittal to the state residence Committee.
Tuition Payment. it is the responsibility of the student to pay tuition
at the rate charged and billed while an appeal is pending. in effect, the student who is classified a nonresident at the time of tuition billing pays the nonresident rate. Conversely, if a student is classified as a resident
at the time of billing, he or she pays the resident rate. Any necessary adjustments in the rate paid will be made at the conclusion of the appeal.
Application of the Law to Specific Situations
Aliens. Aliens who are permanent residents of the United states, or
who hold a visa that will permit eventual permanent residence in the United states, are subject to the same considerations with respect to determination of legal residence as citizens. An alien abiding in the United states under a visa conditioned at least in part upon intent not to abandon a foreign domicile cannot be classified a resident. An alien abiding in the United states under a visa issued for a purpose that is so restricted as to
be fundamentally incompatible with an assertion by the alien of bona fide intent to establish a legal residence cannot be classified a resident.
Possession of certain other immigration documents may also allow an alien to be considered for in-state tuition status. for more details, aliens should consult their admissions offices and the Manual. Aliens must file a residence status supplemental form in addition to the forms normally required of applicants for resident status for tuition
￼
purposes. Aliens should also provide a copy of the front and back of
the document(s) that they claim allow them to remain in the United states and establish a legal residence. More information concerning
alien resident status for tuition purposes information and supplemental applications may be found online at registrar.unc.edu/Academicservices/ residency/index.htm.
Married Persons. The north Carolina resident status for tuition purposes statute provides a special provision for legal residents who are married. This provision is called the “spouse-pair” provision.
The domicile of a married person, irrespective of sex, is determined by reference to all relevant evidence of domiciliary intent. no person is precluded, solely by reason of marriage to a person domiciled outside
of north Carolina, from establishing or maintaining legal residence in north Carolina. no person is deemed, solely by reason of marriage to a person domiciled in north Carolina, to have established or maintained a legal residence in north Carolina. The fact of marriage and the place of the domicile of the student’s spouse are deemed relevant evidence to be considered in ascertaining domiciliary intent.
if a person otherwise can demonstrate compliance with the fundamental statutory requirement that he or she be a legal resident of north Carolina before the beginning of the term for which resident status is sought, the second statutory requirement relating to duration of residence may be satisfied derivatively, in less than 12 months, by reference to the length
of the legal residence of the person’s spouse, if the spouse has been a legal resident of the state for the requisite 12-month period.
if a person believes that he or she qualifies for the marital status provision, special application procedures must be followed. A separate supplemental spousal residency application should be filed at the same time as the residency form is submitted. residency applications of persons who are married and claiming the north Carolina “spouse-pair” provision are not to be submitted to the admissions office. They should be filed with the office of the University registrar. Applications for residency and the spouse-pair provision are available online at registrar. unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/Applicationforms/index.htm.
Military Personnel. The domicile of a person employed by the federal government, department of defense, is not necessarily affected by assignment in or reassignment out of north Carolina. such a person may establish domicile by the usual requirements of residential act plus intent. no person loses his or her in-state resident status solely
by serving in the armed forces outside of the state of north Carolina. see the section entitled “Military tuition benefit” for other benefits provided to military personnel and their dependents.
Minors. A minor is any person who has not reached the age of 18 years. Under the common law, a minor child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated is presumed to have the domicile of his or her father. This presumption may be rebutted if a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the mother and father have separate domiciles and that, under the circumstances, the child can fairly be said to derive his or
her domicile from the mother. if the father is deceased, the domicile of the minor is that of the surviving mother. if the parents are divorced
or legally separated, the domicile of the minor is that of the parent having custody by virtue of a court order; or, if no custody has been granted by virtue of court order, the domicile of the minor is that of the parent with whom he or she lives; or, if the minor lives with neither parent, in the absence of a custody award, the domicile of the minor is presumed to remain that of the father. if the minor lives for part of the year with each parent, in the absence of a custody award, the minor’s domicile is presumed to remain that of the father. if the minor has lived in north Carolina for five years as set forth above in “burden of Proof and statutory Prima facie evidence,” subsection a, the common
law presumptions do not absolutely control on the issue of the minor’s domicile, but they continue to be very strong evidence thereof.
in determining residence status for tuition purposes, there are three exceptions to the above provisions:
• If a minor’s parents are divorced, separated, or otherwise living apart and one parent is a legal resident of north Carolina, during the time period when that parent is entitled to claim, and does claim, the minor as a dependent on the north Carolina individual income tax return, the minor is deemed to be a legal resident of north Carolina for tuition purposes, notwithstanding any judicially determined custody award with respect to the minor.
• If immediately prior to his or her 18th birthday a person would have been deemed a north Carolina legal resident under this provision
but he or she achieves majority before enrolling in a north Carolina institution of higher education, that person will not lose the benefit of this provision if the following conditions are met:
a. Upon achieving majority the person must act, as much as possible, in a manner consistent with bona fide legal residence in north Carolina; and
b. The person must begin enrollment at a north Carolina institution of higher education not later than the fall academic term next following completion of education prerequisite to admission at the institution.
• If immediately prior to beginning an enrolled term the minor has lived in north Carolina for five or more consecutive years in the home of
an adult relative (other than a parent) who is a legal resident of north Carolina, and if the adult relative during those years has functioned
as a de facto guardian of the minor, then the minor is considered
a legal resident of north Carolina for tuition purposes. if a minor qualified for resident status for tuition purposes under this provision immediately prior to his or her 18th birthday, then, upon becoming 18, he or she will be deemed a legal resident of north Carolina of at least 12 months’ duration.
even though a person is a minor, under certain circumstances the person may be treated by the law as being sufficiently independent from his or her parents as to enjoy a species of adulthood for legal purposes. if the minor marries or obtains a judicial decree of emancipation under north Carolina General statutes section 7A–717, et seq., he or she is emancipated. The consequence, for present purposes, of such emancipation is that the affected person is presumed to be capable of establishing a domicile independent of that of the parents; it remains for that person to demonstrate that a separate domicile has, in fact, been established.
Prisoners. There are special provisions concerning domicile of prisoners. for more information, persons to whom these provisions may apply should consult the Manual.
Property and Taxes. ownership of property in or payment of taxes
to the state of north Carolina apart from legal residence will not qualify one for the in-state tuition rate; homeownership alone does not necessarily qualify one for the tuition benefit.
students or prospective students who believe that they are entitled to be classified residents for tuition purposes should be aware that the processing of requests and appeals can take a considerable amount
of time. one should not apply until they have met the minimum requirements of having an established 12-month domicile along with physical presence.
The University follows the application guidelines of the state residence Committee. Applications not received by the applicable deadlines are not accepted for consideration. The deadline to submit an application

￼along with all supporting documentation cannot be later than the 10th business day of the term for which the applicant is seeking residency for tuition. deadlines are posted on the office of the University registrar’s web site at registrar.unc.edu/Academicservices/residency/ importantdates/index.htm.
Benefit for UNC Employees and Related Persons
full-time, permanent employees of UnC who are legal residents of north Carolina may qualify for the in-state tuition rate even if they do not meet the 12-month requirement.
This provision includes spouses and dependent children of the employee. The employee must be full-time, permanent, and a legal resident of north Carolina. further, if it is a child who seeks to qualify, the child must be a dependent (as defined by tax dependency laws). finally, if the person qualifies for this benefit, there is no limit on the number or type of courses for which the classification will apply.
Please consult the Manual at www.northcarolina.edu/legal/residence/ committee/manual/residence_Manual_Aug_2010.pdf to learn more about the benefit. Application information may be obtained by visiting the office of the University registrar’s web site at registrar.unc.edu.
