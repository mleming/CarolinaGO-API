Therefore, we emphasize questions of the organization of the profession and the delivery of legal services to the middle class and the poor, as well as materials on professional responsibility. Effectively, the strategies and activities of public interest lawyers depend on what legal claims are possible at the state and federal levels and on the roles they play in work with community activists. We therefore explore these issues systematically, allowing emphasis on different themes and substantive areas depending on the interests and focus of the professor and students. Social Justice Lawyering involves several aspects: the organization of the profession (bringing together lawyers with people in need of legal services), work to carve out legal claims on behalf of oppressed people and to defend what has been won before, and the struggles in the lives of real people and communities for whom lawyers are only usually a small part of the story.",

                "description": " The Privacy Law Seminar explores United States privacy law and provides brief coverage of foreign privacy law. The seminar introduces students to a sampling of privacy law and provides an opportunity to focus on a particular privacy law area while improving writing skills. Each student is expected to create a high-quality academic-style paper that meets the School's rigorous writing requirement. Peer comments on paper drafts and guidance from the professor provide a framework for development of writing skills. The course introduces the idea of a body of privacy law, but reveals the hit-and-miss approach that characterizes constitutional, common law, statutory, and regulatory privacy law in the United States. Students will examine examples of privacy law in information and decisional privacy areas involving topics such as media, health, criminal investigation, anonymity, employment, public records, consumer behavior, and various aspects of personal autonomy. Not all aspects of privacy law will be covered each semester. Students will discover that privacy law is a growing area of practice with challenges of harmonizing state, federal, and foreign laws.",

                "description": " Brown Spring 2015: A highly practical course designed to teach students how to make wise strategic choices so that they can use the law effectively to represent their clients. What remedies to seek and how to frame the issues most effectively are recurrent themes of the course, entailing an examination of the interplay of remedy and substantive law upon each other. Providing an overview of much of the curriculum, this is a great bar prep course. Part of its value lies in the coverage of equity, which has generated some notable recent supreme Court opinions and has been heavily tested recently. Equity and equitable remedies such as specific performance, injunction, and constructive trust are explored, and relevant jurisdictional issues are addressed. Restitution is a second major emphasis, both as to substantive and remedial aspects, with coverage of legal and equitable restitution. An overview of damages highlights goals and basic premises of that more familiar remedy. The discussion of elements and alternative measures of monetary recovery makes an effective review of the first year and also introduces new material. A number of limiting theories and doctrines provide tools needed by an attorney to avoid or limit recovery. Burk Fall 2014: This course explores what litigants can (and can't) get if they win, or correspondingly what happens to them if they lose, with an emphasis on strategic and practical choices in practice. It is strongly recommended for any student considering a career that involves civil litigation, but will also be of use to transactional lawyers, who must consider what can happen if a deal fails or is disputed. Remedies is on the Multistate Bar Examination, and the interplay between available remedies and the substantive and procedural law governing a claim and its adjudication makes this an excellent bar review course. Subjects will include the types and measures of damages available in different areas of substantive law; equity jurisdiction and equitable remedies such as injunction, specific performance and constructive trust; and restitution and restitutionary remedies.",

The course will provide students from both professional schools the context they will need to communicate across disciplines. To facilitate interdisciplinary connections, teams of JD and MD students will work together on in-class presentations or other group projects that explore the legal and medical considerations surrounding a subject. Topics for the course will run the gamut from health care organization and financing to patient care issues. Specific topics may include, for example:   informed consent;  organ transplant regulation;  end-of-life care and medical futility disputes;  health care fraud and abuse laws;  infectious disease surveillance, reporting,and controllaws;  regulation of medical research;  business transactions with physicians; and  regulation of reproductive health care.",

                "description": "This course will take place in Rwanda and The Hague for six weeks during the summer term. In 1993, Rwanda, an African country roughly the size of Maryland, experienced a genocide that resulted in the horrific deaths of an estimated one million citizens. Since then, Rwanda has struggled to achieve justice for the genocides perpetrators and its victims. It also has made uneven progress toward sustainable democratic governance. Through readings and site visits, students in this course will study the details of the Rwandan genocide, including the roles, positive and otherwise, that international legal institutions played in the crisis and its aftermath. They will study international human rights standards, with a particular focus on how those standards apply to individuals and institutions responsible for genocide. Finally, students will study international criminal law with an emphasis on the rapid expansion in recent decades of legal standards and enforcement mechanisms. They will study use of ad hoc international criminal tribunals, including but not limited to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Having studied genocide, human rights, and international criminal law, students will complete the seminar by visiting the International Criminal Court in The Hague to meet with and interview prosecutors, lawyers, judges, and court administrators.",

Students in this course will explore how the history and culture of Rwanda have helped give shape to its contemporary laws and legal system. They will study the controversial topic of ethnicity in Rwanda, the countrys colonial legacy, as well as its post-Independence political struggles, and explore how those factors have shaped Rwandas legal system. As a central part of this exploration, students will form a detailed understanding of Rwandas contemporary legal institutions, including its written laws, its domestic (state and customary) court systems, its law enforcement system, and its bar(s) and legal professions. Although students in this seminar will rely on carefully chosen readings, they also will benefit from frequent guest lectures by Rwandan academics, lawyers, judges, and law-related NGO officials. In addition, students will be called upon to engage in a mix of interviewing and observation as a way of gathering information regarding how the legal system functions (or does not) in practice.",
